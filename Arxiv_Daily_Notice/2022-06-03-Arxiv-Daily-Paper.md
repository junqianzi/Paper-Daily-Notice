 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports on the development, execution, and open-sourcing of a new robotics course at MIT. The course is a modern take on "Visual Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles" (VNAV) and targets first-year graduate students and senior undergraduates with prior exposure to robotics. VNAV has the goal of preparing the students to perform research in robotics and vision-based navigation, with emphasis on drones and self-driving cars. The course spans the entire autonomous navigation pipeline; as such, it covers a broad set of topics, including geometric control and trajectory optimization, 2D and 3D computer vision, visual and visual-inertial odometry, place recognition, simultaneous localization and mapping, and geometric deep learning for perception. VNAV has three key features. First, it bridges traditional computer vision and robotics courses by exposing the challenges that are specific to embodied intelligence, e.g., limited computation and need for just-in-time and robust perception to close the loop over control and decision making. Second, it strikes a balance between depth and breadth by combining rigorous technical notes (including topics that are less explored in typical robotics courses, e.g., on-manifold optimization) with slides and videos showcasing the latest research results. Third, it provides a compelling approach to hands-on robotics education by leveraging a physical drone platform (mostly suitable for small residential courses) and a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator (open-source and scalable to large online courses). VNAV has been offered at MIT in the Falls of 2018-2021 and is now publicly available on MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW).

 - **Abstract**
 Can an autonomous agent navigate in a new environment without building an explicit map? For the task of PointGoal navigation ('Go to $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$') under idealized settings (no RGB-D and actuation noise, perfect GPS+Compass), the answer is a clear 'yes' - map-less neural models composed of task-agnostic components (CNNs and RNNs) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning achieve 100% Success on a standard dataset (Gibson). However, for PointNav in a realistic setting (RGB-D and actuation noise, no GPS+Compass), this is an open question; one we tackle in this paper. The strongest published result for this task is 71.7% Success. First, we identify the main (perhaps, only) cause of the drop in performance: the absence of GPS+Compass. An agent with perfect GPS+Compass faced with RGB-D sensing and actuation noise achieves 99.8% Success (Gibson-v2 val). This suggests that (to paraphrase a meme) robust visual odometry is all we need for realistic PointNav; if we can achieve that, we can ignore the sensing and actuation noise. With that as our operating hypothesis, we scale the dataset and model size, and develop human-annotation-free data-augmentation techniques to train models for visual odometry. We advance the state of art on the Habitat Realistic PointNav Challenge from 71% to 94% Success (+32, 4% relative) and 53% to 74% SPL (+39, 6% relative). While our approach does not saturate or 'solve' this dataset, this strong improvement combined with promising zero-shot sim2real transfer (to a LoCoBot) provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that explicit mapping may not be necessary for navigation, even in a realistic setting.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has been wildly applied to various tasks for its high-quality representation of 3D scenes. It takes long per-scene training time and per-image testing time. In this paper, we present EfficientNeRF as an efficient NeRF-based method to represent 3D scene and synthesize novel-view images. Although several ways exist to accelerate the training or testing process, it is still difficult to much reduce time for both phases simultaneously. We analyze the density and weight distribution of the sampled points then propose valid and pivotal sampling at the coarse and fine stage, respectively, to significantly improve sampling efficiency. In addition, we design a novel data structure to cache the whole scene during testing to accelerate the rendering speed. Overall, our method can reduce over 88\% of training time, reach rendering speed of over 200 FPS, while still achieving competitive accuracy. Experiments prove that our method promotes the practicality of NeRF in the real world and enables many applications.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00744
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00744
 - **Abstract**
 We study the sequential calibration of estimations in a quantized isotonic L2 regression setting. We start by showing that the optimal calibrated quantized estimations can be acquired from the traditional isotonic L2 regression solution. We modify the traditional PAVA algorithm to create calibrators for both batch and sequential optimization of the quantized isotonic regression problem. Our algorithm can update the optimal quantized monotone mapping for the samples observed so far in linear space and logarithmic time per new unordered sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Adversarial attacks modify images with perturbations that change the prediction of classifiers. These modified images, known as adversarial examples, expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural network classifiers. In this paper, we investigate the predictability of the mapping between the classes predicted for original images and for their corresponding adversarial examples. This predictability relates to the possibility of retrieving the original predictions and hence reversing the induced misclassification. We refer to this property as the reversibility of an adversarial attack, and quantify reversibility as the accuracy in retrieving the original class or the true class of an adversarial example. We present an approach that reverses the effect of an adversarial attack on a classifier using a prior set of classification results. We analyse the reversibility of state-of-the-art adversarial attacks on benchmark classifiers and discuss the factors that affect the reversibility.

### SparseDet: Towards End-to-End 3D Object Detection

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00960
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00960
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose SparseDet for end-to-end 3D object detection from point cloud. Existing works on 3D object detection rely on dense object candidates over all locations in a 3D or 2D grid following the mainstream methods for object detection in 2D images. However, this dense paradigm requires expertise in data to fulfill the gap between label and detection. As a new detection paradigm, SparseDet maintains a fixed set of learnable proposals to represent latent candidates and directly perform classification and localization for 3D objects through stacked transformers. It demonstrates that effective 3D object detection can be achieved with none of post-processing such as redundant removal and non-maximum suppression. With a properly designed network, SparseDet achieves highly competitive detection accuracy while running with a more efficient speed of 34.5 FPS. We believe this end-to-end paradigm of SparseDet will inspire new thinking on the sparsity of 3D object detection.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00771
 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based neural networks have surpassed promising performance on many biomedical image segmentation tasks due to a better global information modeling from the self-attention mechanism. However, most methods are still designed for 2D medical images while ignoring the essential 3D volume information. The main challenge for 3D transformer-based segmentation methods is the quadratic complexity introduced by the self-attention mechanism \cite{vaswani2017attention}. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer architecture for 3D medical image segmentation using an encoder-decoder style architecture with linear complexity. Furthermore, we newly introduce a dynamic token concept to further reduce the token numbers for self-attention calculation. Taking advantage of the global information modeling, we provide uncertainty maps from different hierarchy stages. We evaluate this method on multiple challenging CT pancreas segmentation datasets. Our promising results show that our novel 3D Transformer-based segmentor could provide promising highly feasible segmentation performance and accurate uncertainty quantification using single annotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised learning for computer vision has achieved tremendous progress and improved many downstream vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach. Our code will be publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great significance in the quantitative analysis of skin cancers, which is yet challenging even for dermatologists due to the inherent issues, i.e., considerable size, shape and color variation, and ambiguous boundaries. Recent vision transformers have shown promising performance in handling the variation through global context modeling. Still, they have not thoroughly solved the problem of ambiguous boundaries as they ignore the complementary usage of the boundary knowledge and global contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-scale boundary-aware transformer, \textbf{XBound-Former}, to simultaneously address the variation and boundary problems of skin lesion segmentation. XBound-Former is a purely attention-based network and catches boundary knowledge via three specially designed learners. We evaluate the model on two skin lesion datasets, ISIC-2016\&PH$^2$ and ISIC-2018, where our model consistently outperforms other convolution- and transformer-based models, especially on the boundary-wise metrics. We extensively verify the generalization ability of polyp lesion segmentation that has similar characteristics, and our model can also yield significant improvement compared to the latest models.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer has become ubiquitous due to its dominant performance in various NLP and image processing tasks. However, it lacks understanding of how to generate mathematically grounded uncertainty estimates for transformer architectures. Models equipped with such uncertainty estimates can typically improve predictive performance, make networks robust, avoid over-fitting and used as acquisition function in active learning. In this paper, we introduce BayesFormer, a Transformer model with dropouts designed by Bayesian theory. We proposed a new theoretical framework to extend the approximate variational inference-based dropout to Transformer-based architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate the proposed architecture in four paradigms and show improvements across the board: language modeling and classification, long-sequence understanding, machine translation and acquisition function for active learning.

 - **Abstract**
 U-Nets have achieved tremendous success in medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, it may suffer limitations in global (long-range) contextual interactions and edge-detail preservation. In contrast, Transformer has an excellent ability to capture long-range dependencies by leveraging the self-attention mechanism into the encoder. Although Transformer was born to model the long-range dependency on the extracted feature maps, it still suffers from extreme computational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature maps. This motivates us to design the efficiently Transformer-based UNet model and study the feasibility of Transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. To this end, we propose to self-distill a Transformer-based UNet for medical image segmentation, which simultaneously learns global semantic information and local spatial-detailed features. Meanwhile, a local multi-scale fusion block is first proposed to refine fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the encoder by the main CNN stem through self-distillation, only computed during training and removed at inference with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on BraTS 2019 and CHAOS datasets show that our MISSU achieves the best performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging (few-shot) layout-to-image generation tasks by accurately modeling textures, structures and relationships contained in a complex scene. After compressing RGB images into patch tokens, we propose the Transformer with Focal Attention (TwFA) for exploring dependencies of object-to-object, object-to-patch and patch-to-patch. Compared to existing CNN-based and Transformer-based generation models that entangled modeling on pixel-level&patch-level and object-level&patch-level respectively, the proposed focal attention predicts the current patch token by only focusing on its highly-related tokens that specified by the spatial layout, thereby achieving disambiguation during training. Furthermore, the proposed TwFA largely increases the data efficiency during training, therefore we propose the first few-shot complex scene generation strategy based on the well-trained TwFA. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our method, which significantly increases both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual realism with respect to state-of-the-art CNN-based and transformer-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/JohnDreamer/TwFA.

 - **Abstract**
 Expression of sentiment in parliamentary debates is deemed to be significantly different from that on social media or in product reviews. This paper adds to an emerging body of research on parliamentary debates with a dataset of sentences annotated for detection sentiment polarity in political discourse. We sample the sentences for annotation from the proceedings of three Southeast European parliaments: Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia. A six-level schema is applied to the data with the aim of training a classification model for the detection of sentiment in parliamentary proceedings. Krippendorff's alpha measuring the inter-annotator agreement ranges from 0.6 for the six-level annotation schema to 0.75 for the three-level schema and 0.83 for the two-level schema. Our initial experiments on the dataset show that transformer models perform significantly better than those using a simpler architecture. Furthermore, regardless of the similarity of the three languages, we observe differences in performance across different languages. Performing parliament-specific training and evaluation shows that the main reason for the differing performance between parliaments seems to be the different complexity of the automatic classification task, which is not observable in annotator performance. Language distance does not seem to play any role neither in annotator nor in automatic classification performance. We release the dataset and the best-performing model under permissive licences.

 - **Abstract**
 Cervical cancer is the seventh most common cancer among all the cancers worldwide and the fourth most common cancer among women. Cervical cytopathology image classification is an important method to diagnose cervical cancer. Manual screening of cytopathology images is time-consuming and error-prone. The emergence of the automatic computer-aided diagnosis system solves this problem. This paper proposes a framework called CVM-Cervix based on deep learning to perform cervical cell classification tasks. It can analyze pap slides quickly and accurately. CVM-Cervix first proposes a Convolutional Neural Network module and a Visual Transformer module for local and global feature extraction respectively, then a Multilayer Perceptron module is designed to fuse the local and global features for the final classification. Experimental results show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed CVM-Cervix in the field of cervical Pap smear image classification. In addition, according to the practical needs of clinical work, we perform a lightweight post-processing to compress the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Real-world reinforcement learning tasks often involve some form of partial observability where the observations only give a partial or noisy view of the true state of the world. Such tasks typically require some form of memory, where the agent has access to multiple past observations, in order to perform well. One popular way to incorporate memory is by using a recurrent neural network to access the agent's history. However, recurrent neural networks in reinforcement learning are often fragile and difficult to train, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting and sometimes fail completely as a result. In this work, we propose Deep Transformer Q-Networks (DTQN), a novel architecture utilizing transformers and self-attention to encode an agent's history. DTQN is designed modularly, and we compare results against several modifications to our base model. Our experiments demonstrate the transformer can solve partially observable tasks faster and more stably than previous recurrent approaches.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01127
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a vision-language foundation model called VL-BEiT, which is a bidirectional multimodal Transformer learned by generative pretraining. Our minimalist solution conducts masked prediction on both monomodal and multimodal data with a shared Transformer. Specifically, we perform masked vision-language modeling on image-text pairs, masked language modeling on texts, and masked image modeling on images. VL-BEiT is learned from scratch with one unified pretraining task, one shared backbone, and one-stage training. Our method is conceptually simple and empirically effective. Experimental results show that VL-BEiT obtains strong results on various vision-language benchmarks, such as visual question answering, visual reasoning, and image-text retrieval. Moreover, our method learns transferable visual features, achieving competitive performance on image classification, and semantic segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer, the latest technological advance of deep learning, has gained prevalence in natural language processing or computer vision. Since medical imaging bear some resemblance to computer vision, it is natural to inquire about the status quo of Transformers in medical imaging and ask the question: can the Transformer models transform medical imaging? In this paper, we attempt to make a response to the inquiry. After a brief introduction of the fundamentals of Transformers, especially in comparison with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and highlighting key defining properties that characterize the Transformers, we offer a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based approaches for medical imaging and exhibit current research progresses made in the areas of medical image segmentation, recognition, detection, registration, reconstruction, enhancement, etc. In particular, what distinguishes our review lies in its organization based on the Transformer's key defining properties, which are mostly derived from comparing the Transformer and CNN, and its type of architecture, which specifies the manner in which the Transformer and CNN are combined, all helping the readers to best understand the rationale behind the reviewed approaches. We conclude with discussions of future perspectives.

 It has been observed that visual classification models often rely mostly on the image background, neglecting the foreground, which hurts their robustness to distribution changes. To alleviate this shortcoming, we propose to monitor the model's relevancy signal and manipulate it such that the model is focused on the foreground object. This is done as a finetuning step, involving relatively few samples consisting of pairs of images and their associated foreground masks. Specifically, we encourage the model's relevancy map (i) to assign lower relevance to background regions, (ii) to consider as much information as possible from the foreground, and (iii) we encourage the decisions to have high confidence. When applied to Vision Transformer (ViT) models, a marked improvement in robustness to domain shifts is observed. Moreover, the foreground masks can be obtained automatically, from a self-supervised variant of the ViT model itself; therefore no additional supervision is required.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown rapid progress in computer vision tasks, achieving promising results on various benchmarks. However, due to the massive number of parameters and model design, e.g., attention mechanism, ViT-based models are generally times slower than lightweight convolutional networks. Therefore, the deployment of ViT for real-time applications is particularly challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware such as mobile devices. Recent efforts try to reduce the computation complexity of ViT through network architecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet the inference speed is still unsatisfactory. This leads to an important question: can transformers run as fast as MobileNet while obtaining high performance? To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs. Then we introduce a dimension-consistent pure transformer (without MobileNet blocks) as design paradigm. Finally, we perform latency-driven slimming to get a series of final models dubbed EfficientFormer. Extensive experiments show the superiority of EfficientFormer in performance and speed on mobile devices. Our fastest model, EfficientFormer-L1, achieves 79.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only 1.6 ms inference latency on iPhone 12 (compiled with CoreML), which is even a bit faster than MobileNetV2 (1.7 ms, 71.8% top-1), and our largest model, EfficientFormer-L7, obtains 83.3% accuracy with only 7.0 ms latency. Our work proves that properly designed transformers can reach extremely low latency on mobile devices while maintaining high performance

 - **Abstract**
 The 3rd Japan Automotive AI Challenge was an international online autonomous racing challenge where 164 teams competed in December 2021. This paper outlines the winning strategy to this competition, and the advantages and challenges of using the Autoware.Auto open source autonomous driving platform for multi-agent racing. Our winning approach includes a lane-switching opponent overtaking strategy, a global raceline optimization, and the integration of various tools from Autoware.Auto including a Model-Predictive Controller. We describe the use of perception, planning and control modules for high-speed racing applications and provide experience-based insights on working with Autoware.Auto. While our approach is a rule-based strategy that is suitable for non-interactive opponents, it provides a good reference and benchmark for learning-enabled approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a motion forecasting (behavior prediction) method that meets the latency requirements for autonomous driving in dense urban environments without sacrificing accuracy. A whole-scene sparse input representation allows StopNet to scale to predicting trajectories for hundreds of road agents with reliable latency. In addition to predicting trajectories, our scene encoder lends itself to predicting whole-scene probabilistic occupancy grids, a complementary output representation suitable for busy urban environments. Occupancy grids allow the AV to reason collectively about the behavior of groups of agents without processing their individual trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our sparse input representation and our model in terms of computation and accuracy over three datasets. We further show that co-training consistent trajectory and occupancy predictions improves upon state-of-the-art performance under standard metrics.
