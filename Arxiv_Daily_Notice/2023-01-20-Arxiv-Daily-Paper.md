 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the pure camera-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception removes expensive Lidar sensors, making it a feasible solution for economical autonomous driving. However, most existing BEV solutions either suffer from modest performance or require considerable resources to execute on-vehicle inference. This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, termed Fast-BEV, which is capable of performing real-time BEV perception on the on-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we first empirically find that the BEV representation can be sufficiently powerful without expensive view transformation or depth representation. Starting from M2BEV baseline, we further introduce (1) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and BEV space to avoid over-fitting (2) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to leverage the temporal information (3) an optimized deployment-friendly view transformation to speed up the inference. Through experiments, we show Fast-BEV model family achieves considerable accuracy and efficiency on edge. In particular, our M1 model (R18@256x704) can run over 50FPS on the Tesla T4 platform, with 47.0% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. Our largest model (R101@900x1600) establishes a new state-of-the-art 53.5% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. The code is released at: https://github.com/Sense-GVT/Fast-BEV.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a novel method for using Riemannian Motion Policies on volumetric maps, shown in the example of obstacle avoidance for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). While sampling or optimization-based planners are widely used for obstacle avoidance with volumetric maps, they are computationally expensive and often have inflexible monolithic architectures. Riemannian Motion Policies are a modular, parallelizable, and efficient navigation paradigm but are challenging to use with the widely used voxel-based environment representations. We propose using GPU raycasting and a large number of concurrent policies to provide direct obstacle avoidance using Riemannian Motion Policies in voxelized maps without the need for smoothing or pre-processing of the map. Additionally, we present how the same method can directly plan on LiDAR scans without the need for an intermediate map. We show how this reactive approach compares favorably to traditional planning methods and is able to plan using thousands of rays at kilohertz rates. We demonstrate the planner successfully on a real MAV for static and dynamic obstacles. The presented planner is made available as an open-source software package.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiance fields have gradually become a main representation of media. Although its appearance editing has been studied, how to achieve view-consistent recoloring in an efficient manner is still under explored. We present RecolorNeRF, a novel user-friendly color editing approach for the neural radiance field. Our key idea is to decompose the scene into a set of pure-colored layers, forming a palette. Thus, color manipulation can be conducted by altering the color components of the palette directly. To support efficient palette-based editing, the color of each layer needs to be as representative as possible. In the end, the problem is formulated as in an optimization formula, where the layers and their blending way are jointly optimized with the NeRF itself. Extensive experiments show that our jointly-optimized layer decomposition can be used against multiple backbones and produce photo-realistic recolored novel-view renderings. We demonstrate that RecolorNeRF outperforms baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for color editing even in complex real-world scenes.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model to perform well even on unseen domains. For many real-world machine learning applications, the data distribution often shifts gradually along domain indices. For example, a self-driving car with a vision system drives from dawn to dusk, with the sky darkening gradually. Therefore, the system must be able to adapt to changes in ambient illumination and continue to drive safely on the road. In this paper, we formulate such problems as Evolving Domain Generalization, where a model aims to generalize well on a target domain by discovering and leveraging the evolving pattern of the environment. We then propose Directional Domain Augmentation (DDA), which simulates the unseen target features by mapping source data as augmentations through a domain transformer. Specifically, we formulate DDA as a bi-level optimization problem and solve it through a novel meta-learning approach in the representation space. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic datasets and realworld datasets, and empirical results show that our approach can outperform other existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide machine learning tasks can be formulated as non-convex multi-player games, where Nash equilibrium (NE) is an acceptable solution to all players, since no one can benefit from changing its strategy unilaterally. Attributed to the non-convexity, obtaining the existence condition of global NE is challenging, let alone designing theoretically guaranteed realization algorithms. This paper takes conjugate transformation to the formulation of non-convex multi-player games, and casts the complementary problem into a variational inequality (VI) problem with a continuous pseudo-gradient mapping. We then prove the existence condition of global NE: the solution to the VI problem satisfies a duality relation. Based on this VI formulation, we design a conjugate-based ordinary differential equation (ODE) to approach global NE, which is proved to have an exponential convergence rate. To make the dynamics more implementable, we further derive a discretized algorithm. We apply our algorithm to two typical scenarios: multi-player generalized monotone game and multi-player potential game. In the two settings, we prove that the step-size setting is required to be $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt k)$ to yield the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(1/ k)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt k)$, respectively. Extensive experiments in robust neural network training and sensor localization are in full agreement with our theory.

 - **Abstract**
 A foundational problem in reinforcement learning and interactive decision making is to understand what modeling assumptions lead to sample-efficient learning guarantees, and what algorithm design principles achieve optimal sample complexity. Recently, Foster et al. (2021) introduced the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC), a measure of statistical complexity which leads to upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for a general class of problems encompassing bandits and reinforcement learning with function approximation. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the DEC, the Constrained Decision-Estimation Coefficient, and use it to derive new lower bounds that improve upon prior work on three fronts: - They hold in expectation, with no restrictions on the class of algorithms under consideration. - They hold globally, and do not rely on the notion of localization used by Foster et al. (2021). - Most interestingly, they allow the reference model with respect to which the DEC is defined to be improper, establishing that improper reference models play a fundamental role. We provide upper bounds on regret that scale with the same quantity, thereby closing all but one of the gaps between upper and lower bounds in Foster et al. (2021). Our results apply to both the regret framework and PAC framework, and make use of several new analysis and algorithm design techniques that we anticipate will find broader use.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new paradigm for analysing and finding bugs in quantum circuits. In our approach, the problem is given by a triple $\{P\}\,C\,\{Q\}$ and the question is whether, given a set $P$ of quantum states on the input of a circuit $C$, the set of quantum states on the output is equal to (or included in) a set $Q$. While this is not suitable to specify, e.g., functional correctness of a quantum circuit, it is sufficient to detect many bugs in quantum circuits. We propose a technique based on tree automata to compactly represent sets of quantum states and develop transformers to implement the semantics of quantum gates over this representation. Our technique computes with an algebraic representation of quantum states, avoiding the inaccuracy of working with floating-point numbers. We implemented the proposed approach in a prototype tool and evaluated its performance against various benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation shows that our approach is quite scalable, e.g., we managed to verify a large circuit with 40 qubits and 141,527 gates, or catch bugs injected into a circuit with 320 qubits and 1,758 gates, where all tools we compared with failed. In addition, our work establishes a connection between quantum program verification and automata, opening new possibilities to exploit the richness of automata theory and automata-based verification in the world of quantum computing.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) of vehicles, i.e. tracking vehicles across multiple cameras, is a crucial application for the development of smart city and intelligent traffic system. The main challenges of MTMCT of vehicles include the intra-class variability of the same vehicle and inter-class similarity between different vehicles and how to associate the same vehicle accurately across different cameras under large search space. Previous methods for MTMCT usually use hierarchical clustering of trajectories to conduct cross camera association. However, the search space can be large and does not take spatial and temporal information into consideration. In this paper, we proposed a transformer-based camera link model with spatial and temporal filtering to conduct cross camera tracking. Achieving 73.68% IDF1 on the Nvidia Cityflow V2 dataset test set, showing the effectiveness of our camera link model on multi-target multi-camera tracking.

 - **Abstract**
 Constructing click models and extracting implicit relevance feedback information from the interaction between users and search engines are very important to improve the ranking of search results. Using neural network to model users' click behaviors has become one of the effective methods to construct click models. In this paper, We use Transformer as the backbone network of feature extraction, add filter layer innovatively, and propose a new Filter-Enhanced Transformer Click Model (FE-TCM) for web search. Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of noise on user behavior data, we use the learnable filters to filter log noise. Secondly, following the examination hypothesis, we model the attraction estimator and examination predictor respectively to output the attractiveness scores and examination probabilities. A novel transformer model is used to learn the deeper representation among different features. Finally, we apply the combination functions to integrate attractiveness scores and examination probabilities into the click prediction. From our experiments on two real-world session datasets, it is proved that FE-TCM outperforms the existing click models for the click prediction.
### Revisiting the Spatial and Temporal Modeling for Few-shot Action  Recognition

 - **Abstract**
 Spatial and temporal modeling is one of the most core aspects of few-shot action recognition. Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal relation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without considering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal relations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic information, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of adjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new framework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action recognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial features, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to automatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level spatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a long-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based on the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another short-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics between adjacent frame representations. After that, the final predictions can be obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common frame-level class prototype matcher. We extensively validate the proposed SloshNet on four few-shot action recognition datasets, including Something-Something V2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. It achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods in all datasets.
### PDFormer: Propagation Delay-aware Dynamic Long-range Transformer for  Traffic Flow Prediction

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07945
 - **Abstract**
 As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction: i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map to make our model highly interpretable.
### AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient  Attention Manipulation

 - **Abstract**
 Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.
### Diagnose Like a Pathologist: Transformer-Enabled Hierarchical  Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image  Classification

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08125
 - **Abstract**
 Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and transformers are increasingly popular in histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, unlike human pathologists who selectively observe specific regions of histopathology tissues under different magnifications, most methods do not incorporate multiple resolutions of the WSIs, hierarchically and attentively, thereby leading to a loss of focus on the WSIs and information from other resolutions. To resolve this issue, we propose the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs, which can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs. Within this framework, to further enhance the performance of the transformer and obtain a more holistic WSI (bag) representation, we propose an Integrated Attention Transformer, consisting of multiple Integrated Attention Modules, which is the combination of a transformer layer and an aggregation module that produces a bag representation based on every instance representation in that bag. The results of the experiments show that our method achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple datasets, including Camelyon16, TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and our in-house IMGC dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper demonstrates an approach for learning highly semantic image representations without relying on hand-crafted data-augmentations. We introduce the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA), a non-generative approach for self-supervised learning from images. The idea behind I-JEPA is simple: from a single context block, predict the representations of various target blocks in the same image. A core design choice to guide I-JEPA towards producing semantic representations is the masking strategy; specifically, it is crucial to (a) predict several target blocks in the image, (b) sample target blocks with sufficiently large scale (occupying 15%-20% of the image), and (c) use a sufficiently informative (spatially distributed) context block. Empirically, when combined with Vision Transformers, we find I-JEPA to be highly scalable. For instance, we train a ViT-Huge/16 on ImageNet using 32 A100 GPUs in under 38 hours to achieve strong downstream performance across a wide range of tasks requiring various levels of abstraction, from linear classification to object counting and depth prediction.

### A Light-Weight Communication-Efficient Data Sharing Approach in 5G NR  V2X

 - **Abstract**
 Timeliness of information is critical for Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable highly reliable autonomous driving. However, the current semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) algorithms in the 5th generation New Radio (5G NR) standard can still generate collisions probability, close to 20% with 100 vehicles per kilometer, such that they cannot meet this requirement for BSMs. This paper proposes a Ledger concept, which can communicate collision information to every vehicle in the network within one Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) through the broadcasting of Ledger information. The colliding vehicle is aware that it has collided with other vehicles and will reselect for the next SPS period. Besides that, other protocols follow the SPS. Although it sacrifices 14.29% of resources by including Ledger, it can eventually reduce the collision probability. In this paper, a Monte Carlo simulator is used to verify and analyze the performance of the Ledger system. Numerical results show that abide by the SPS protocol, the Ledger system can make the collision probability converge to zero after amount of RRIs.

 Recently, the pure camera-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception removes expensive Lidar sensors, making it a feasible solution for economical autonomous driving. However, most existing BEV solutions either suffer from modest performance or require considerable resources to execute on-vehicle inference. This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, termed Fast-BEV, which is capable of performing real-time BEV perception on the on-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we first empirically find that the BEV representation can be sufficiently powerful without expensive view transformation or depth representation. Starting from M2BEV baseline, we further introduce (1) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and BEV space to avoid over-fitting (2) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to leverage the temporal information (3) an optimized deployment-friendly view transformation to speed up the inference. Through experiments, we show Fast-BEV model family achieves considerable accuracy and efficiency on edge. In particular, our M1 model (R18@256x704) can run over 50FPS on the Tesla T4 platform, with 47.0% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. Our largest model (R101@900x1600) establishes a new state-of-the-art 53.5% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. The code is released at: https://github.com/Sense-GVT/Fast-BEV.

 - **Abstract**
 Combinatorial Testing (CT) tools are essential to test properly a wide range of systems (train systems, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), autonomous driving systems, etc). While there is an active research community working on developing CT tools, paradoxically little attention has been paid to making available enough resources to test the CT tools themselves. In particular, the set of available benchmarks to asses their correctness, effectiveness and efficiency is rather limited. In this paper, we introduce a new generator of CT benchmarks that essentially borrows the structure contained in the plethora of available Combinatorial Problems from other research communities in order to create meaningful benchmarks. We additionally perform an extensive evaluation of CT tools with these new benchmarks. Thanks to this study we provide some insights on under which circumstances a particular CT tool should be used.
