 - **Abstract**
 Semantic mapping is the task of providing a robot with a map of its environment beyond the open, navigable space of traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms by attaching semantics to locations. The system presented in this work reads door placards to annotate the locations of offices. Whereas prior work on this system developed hand-crafted detectors, this system leverages YOLOv5 for sign detection and EAST for text recognition. Placards are localized by computing their pose from a point cloud in a RGB-D camera frame localized by a modified ORB-SLAM. Semantic mapping is accomplished in a post-processing step after robot exploration from video recording. System performance is reported in terms of the number of placards identified, the accuracy of their placement onto a SLAM map, the accuracy of the map built, and the correctness transcribed placard text.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most complex tasks of decision making and planning is to gather information. This task becomes even more complex when the state is high-dimensional and its belief cannot be expressed with a parametric distribution. Although the state is high-dimensional, in many problems only a small fraction of it might be involved in transitioning the state and generating observations. We exploit this fact to calculate an information-theoretic expected reward, mutual information (MI), over a much lower-dimensional subset of the state, to improve efficiency and without sacrificing accuracy. A similar approach was used in previous works, yet specifically for Gaussian distributions, and we here extend it for general distributions. Moreover, we apply the dimensionality reduction for cases in which the new states are augmented to the previous, yet again without sacrificing accuracy. We then continue by developing an estimator for the MI which works in a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) manner, and avoids the reconstruction of future belief's surfaces. Finally, we show how this work is applied to the informative planning optimization problem. This work is then evaluated in a simulation of an active SLAM problem, where the improvement in both accuracy and timing is demonstrated.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots in the construction industry can reduce costs through constant monitoring of the work progress, using high precision data capturing. Accurate data capturing requires precise localization of the mobile robot within the environment. In this paper we present our novel work on robot localization which extracts geometric, semantic as well as the topological information from the architectural plans in the form of walls and rooms, and creates the topological and metric-semantic layer of the Situational Graphs (S-Graphs) before navigating in the environment. When the robot navigates in the construction environment, it uses the robot odometry and the sensorial observations in the form of planar walls extracted from the 3D lidar measurements, to estimate its pose relying on a particle filter method, by exploiting the previously built situational graph and its available geometric, semantic and topological information. We validate our approach in both simulated and real datasets captured on actual on-going construction sites presenting state-of-the-art results when comparing it against traditional geometry based localization techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision-based localization approaches now underpin newly emerging navigation pipelines for myriad use cases from robotics to assistive technologies. Compared to sensor-based solutions, vision-based localization does not require pre-installed sensor infrastructure, which is costly, time-consuming, and/or often infeasible at scale. Herein, we propose a novel vision-based localization pipeline for a specific use case: navigation support for end-users with blindness and low vision. Given a query image taken by an end-user on a mobile application, the pipeline leverages a visual place recognition (VPR) algorithm to find similar images in a reference image database of the target space. The geolocations of these similar images are utilized in downstream tasks that employ a weighted-average method to estimate the end-user's location and a perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm to estimate the end-user's direction. Additionally, this system implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate a shortest path based on a navigable map that includes trip origin and destination. The topometric map used for localization and navigation is built using a customized graphical user interface that projects a 3D reconstructed sparse map, built from a sequence of images, to the corresponding a priori 2D floor plan. Sequential images used for map construction can be collected in a pre-mapping step or scavenged through public databases/citizen science. The end-to-end system can be installed on any internet-accessible device with a camera that hosts a custom mobile application. For evaluation purposes, mapping and localization were tested in a complex hospital environment. The evaluation results demonstrate that our system can achieve localization with an average error of less than 1 meter without knowledge of the camera's intrinsic parameters, such as focal length.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11368
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a spherical fingertip sensor for dynamic manipulation. It is based on barometric pressure and time-of-flight proximity sensors and is low-latency, compact, and physically robust. The sensor uses a trained neural network to estimate the contact location and three-axis contact forces based on data from the pressure sensors, which are embedded within the sensor's sphere of polyurethane rubber. The time-of-flight sensors face in three different outward directions, and an integrated microcontroller samples each of the individual sensors at up to 200 Hz. To quantify the effect of system latency on dynamic manipulation performance, we develop and analyze a metric called the collision impulse ratio and characterize the end-to-end latency of our new sensor. We also present experimental demonstrations with the sensor, including measuring contact transitions, performing coarse mapping, maintaining a contact force with a moving object, and reacting to avoid collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 Realistic dynamic garments on animated characters have many AR/VR applications. While authoring such dynamic garment geometry is still a challenging task, data-driven simulation provides an attractive alternative, especially if it can be controlled simply using the motion of the underlying character. In this work, we focus on motion guided dynamic 3D garments, especially for loose garments. In a data-driven setup, we first learn a generative space of plausible garment geometries. Then, we learn a mapping to this space to capture the motion dependent dynamic deformations, conditioned on the previous state of the garment as well as its relative position with respect to the underlying body. Technically, we model garment dynamics, driven using the input character motion, by predicting per-frame local displacements in a canonical state of the garment that is enriched with frame-dependent skinning weights to bring the garment to the global space. We resolve any remaining per-frame collisions by predicting residual local displacements. The resultant garment geometry is used as history to enable iterative rollout prediction. We demonstrate plausible generalization to unseen body shapes and motion inputs, and show improvements over multiple state-of-the-art alternatives.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11727
 - **Abstract**
 Existing advertisements click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are mainly dependent on behavior ID features, which are learned based on the historical user-ad interactions. Nevertheless, behavior ID features relying on historical user behaviors are not feasible to describe new ads without previous interactions with users. To overcome the limitations of behavior ID features in modeling new ads, we exploit the visual content in ads to boost the performance of CTR prediction models. Specifically, we map each ad into a set of visual IDs based on its visual content. These visual IDs are further used for generating the visual embedding for enhancing CTR prediction models. We formulate the learning of visual IDs into a supervised quantization problem. Due to a lack of class labels for commercial images in advertisements, we exploit image textual descriptions as the supervision to optimize the image extractor for generating effective visual IDs. Meanwhile, since the hard quantization is non-differentiable, we soften the quantization operation to make it support the end-to-end network training. After mapping each image into visual IDs, we learn the embedding for each visual ID based on the historical user-ad interactions accumulated in the past. Since the visual ID embedding depends only on the visual content, it generalizes well to new ads. Meanwhile, the visual ID embedding complements the ad behavior ID embedding. Thus, it can considerably boost the performance of the CTR prediction models previously relying on behavior ID features for both new ads and ads that have accumulated rich user behaviors. After incorporating the visual ID embedding in the CTR prediction model of Baidu online advertising, the average CTR of ads improves by 1.46%, and the total charge increases by 1.10%.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots have been used in all sorts of automation, and yet the design of robots remains mainly a manual task. We seek to provide design tools to automate the design of robots themselves. An important challenge in robot design automation is the large and complex design search space which grows exponentially with the number of components, making optimization difficult and sample inefficient. In this work, we present Grammar-guided Latent Space Optimization (GLSO), a framework that transforms design automation into a low-dimensional continuous optimization problem by training a graph variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a mapping between the graph-structured design space and a continuous latent space. This transformation allows optimization to be conducted in a continuous latent space, where sample efficiency can be significantly boosted by applying algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization. GLSO guides training of the VAE using graph grammar rules and robot world space features, such that the learned latent space focus on valid robots and is easier for the optimization algorithm to explore. Importantly, the trained VAE can be reused to search for designs specialized to multiple different tasks without retraining. We evaluate GLSO by designing robots for a set of locomotion tasks in simulation, and demonstrate that our method outperforms related state-of-the-art robot design automation methods.
### Conditional GANs for Sonar Image Filtering with Applications to  Underwater Occupancy Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Underwater robots typically rely on acoustic sensors like sonar to perceive their surroundings. However, these sensors are often inundated with multiple sources and types of noise, which makes using raw data for any meaningful inference with features, objects, or boundary returns very difficult. While several conventional methods of dealing with noise exist, their success rates are unsatisfactory. This paper presents a novel application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to train a model to produce noise-free sonar images, outperforming several conventional filtering methods. Estimating free space is crucial for autonomous robots performing active exploration and mapping. Thus, we apply our approach to the task of underwater occupancy mapping and show superior free and occupied space inference when compared to conventional methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Graph convolutional learning has led to many exciting discoveries in diverse areas. However, in some applications, traditional graphs are insufficient to capture the structure and intricacies of the data. In such scenarios, multigraphs arise naturally as discrete structures in which complex dynamics can be embedded. In this paper, we develop convolutional information processing on multigraphs and introduce convolutional multigraph neural networks (MGNNs). To capture the complex dynamics of information diffusion within and across each of the multigraph's classes of edges, we formalize a convolutional signal processing model, defining the notions of signals, filtering, and frequency representations on multigraphs. Leveraging this model, we develop a multigraph learning architecture, including a sampling procedure to reduce computational complexity. The introduced architecture is applied towards optimal wireless resource allocation and a hate speech localization task, offering improved performance over traditional graph neural networks.

 - **Abstract**
 Many high precision (dis)assembly tasks are still being performed by humans, whereas this is an ideal opportunity for automation. This paper provides a framework which enables a non-expert human operator to teach a robotic arm to do complex precision tasks. The framework uses a variable Cartesian impedance controller to execute trajectories learned from kinesthetic human demonstrations. Feedback can be given to interactively reshape or speed up the original demonstration. Board localization is done through a visual estimation of the task board position and refined through haptic feedback. Our framework is tested on the Robothon benchmark disassembly challenge, where the robot has to perform complex precision tasks, such as a key insertion. The results show high success rates for each of the manipulation subtasks, including cases when the box is in novel poses. An ablation study is also performed to evaluate the components of the framework.

 - **Abstract**
 As an increasingly popular task in multimedia information retrieval, video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to localize the target moment from an untrimmed video according to a given language query. Most previous methods depend heavily on numerous manual annotations (i.e., moment boundaries), which are extremely expensive to acquire in practice. In addition, due to the domain gap between different datasets, directly applying these pre-trained models to an unseen domain leads to a significant performance drop. In this paper, we focus on a novel task: cross-domain VMR, where fully-annotated datasets are available in one domain (``source domain''), but the domain of interest (``target domain'') only contains unannotated datasets. As far as we know, we present the first study on cross-domain VMR. To address this new task, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Cross-Domain Alignment (MMCDA) network to transfer the annotation knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, due to the domain discrepancy between the source and target domains and the semantic gap between videos and queries, directly applying trained models to the target domain generally leads to a performance drop. To solve this problem, we develop three novel modules: (i) a domain alignment module is designed to align the feature distributions between different domains of each modality; (ii) a cross-modal alignment module aims to map both video and query features into a joint embedding space and to align the feature distributions between different modalities in the target domain; (iii) a specific alignment module tries to obtain the fine-grained similarity between a specific frame and the given query for optimal localization. By jointly training these three modules, our MMCDA can learn domain-invariant and semantic-aligned cross-modal representations.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots in the construction industry can reduce costs through constant monitoring of the work progress, using high precision data capturing. Accurate data capturing requires precise localization of the mobile robot within the environment. In this paper we present our novel work on robot localization which extracts geometric, semantic as well as the topological information from the architectural plans in the form of walls and rooms, and creates the topological and metric-semantic layer of the Situational Graphs (S-Graphs) before navigating in the environment. When the robot navigates in the construction environment, it uses the robot odometry and the sensorial observations in the form of planar walls extracted from the 3D lidar measurements, to estimate its pose relying on a particle filter method, by exploiting the previously built situational graph and its available geometric, semantic and topological information. We validate our approach in both simulated and real datasets captured on actual on-going construction sites presenting state-of-the-art results when comparing it against traditional geometry based localization techniques.
### View-Invariant Skeleton-based Action Recognition via Global-Local  Contrastive Learning

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11634
 - **Abstract**
 Skeleton-based human action recognition has been drawing more interest recently due to its low sensitivity to appearance changes and the accessibility of more skeleton data. However, even the 3D skeletons captured in practice are still sensitive to the viewpoint and direction gave the occlusion of different human-body joints and the errors in human joint localization. Such view variance of skeleton data may significantly affect the performance of action recognition. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new view-invariant representation learning approach, without any manual action labeling, for skeleton-based human action recognition. Specifically, we leverage the multi-view skeleton data simultaneously taken for the same person in the network training, by maximizing the mutual information between the representations extracted from different views, and then propose a global-local contrastive loss to model the multi-scale co-occurrence relationships in both spatial and temporal domains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to the view difference of the input skeleton data and significantly boosts the performance of unsupervised skeleton-based human action methods, resulting in new state-of-the-art accuracies on two challenging multi-view benchmarks of PKUMMD and NTU RGB+D.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11673
 - **Abstract**
 A self-driving car must be able to reliably handle adverse weather conditions (e.g., snowy) to operate safely. In this paper, we investigate the idea of turning sensor inputs (i.e., images) captured in an adverse condition into a benign one (i.e., sunny), upon which the downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) can attain high accuracy. Prior work primarily formulates this as an unpaired image-to-image translation problem due to the lack of paired images captured under the exact same camera poses and semantic layouts. While perfectly-aligned images are not available, one can easily obtain coarsely-paired images. For instance, many people drive the same routes daily in both good and adverse weather; thus, images captured at close-by GPS locations can form a pair. Though data from repeated traversals are unlikely to capture the same foreground objects, we posit that they provide rich contextual information to supervise the image translation model. To this end, we propose a novel training objective leveraging coarsely-aligned image pairs. We show that our coarsely-aligned training scheme leads to a better image translation quality and improved downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and visual localization.

 - **Abstract**
 The Big Video Data generated in today's smart cities has raised concerns from its purposeful usage perspective, where surveillance cameras, among many others are the most prominent resources to contribute to the huge volumes of data, making its automated analysis a difficult task in terms of computation and preciseness. Violence Detection (VD), broadly plunging under Action and Activity recognition domain, is used to analyze Big Video data for anomalous actions incurred due to humans. The VD literature is traditionally based on manually engineered features, though advancements to deep learning based standalone models are developed for real-time VD analysis. This paper focuses on overview of deep sequence learning approaches along with localization strategies of the detected violence. This overview also dives into the initial image processing and machine learning-based VD literature and their possible advantages such as efficiency against the current complex models. Furthermore,the datasets are discussed, to provide an analysis of the current models, explaining their pros and cons with future directions in VD domain derived from an in-depth analysis of the previous methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple business scenarios require an automated generation of descriptive human-readable text from structured input data. Hence, fact-to-text generation systems have been developed for various downstream tasks like generating soccer reports, weather and financial reports, medical reports, person biographies, etc. Unfortunately, previous work on fact-to-text (F2T) generation has focused primarily on English mainly due to the high availability of relevant datasets. Only recently, the problem of cross-lingual fact-to-text (XF2T) was proposed for generation across multiple languages alongwith a dataset, XALIGN for eight languages. However, there has been no rigorous work on the actual XF2T generation problem. We extend XALIGN dataset with annotated data for four more languages: Punjabi, Malayalam, Assamese and Oriya. We conduct an extensive study using popular Transformer-based text generation models on our extended multi-lingual dataset, which we call XALIGNV2. Further, we investigate the performance of different text generation strategies: multiple variations of pretraining, fact-aware embeddings and structure-aware input encoding. Our extensive experiments show that a multi-lingual mT5 model which uses fact-aware embeddings with structure-aware input encoding leads to best results on average across the twelve languages. We make our code, dataset and model publicly available, and hope that this will help advance further research in this critical area.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have resulted in remarkable achievements in the field of image processing. Inspired by this great success, the application of Transformers to 3D point cloud processing has drawn more and more attention. This paper presents a novel point cloud representational learning network, 3D Point Cloud Transformer with Dual Self-attention (3DPCT) and an encoder-decoder structure. Specifically, 3DPCT has a hierarchical encoder, which contains two local-global dual-attention modules for the classification task (three modules for the segmentation task), with each module consisting of a Local Feature Aggregation (LFA) block and a Global Feature Learning (GFL) block. The GFL block is dual self-attention, with both point-wise and channel-wise self-attention to improve feature extraction. Moreover, in LFA, to better leverage the local information extracted, a novel point-wise self-attention model, named as Point-Patch Self-Attention (PPSA), is designed. The performance is evaluated on both classification and segmentation datasets, containing both synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on both classification and segmentation tasks.

 Colonoscopy is a routine outpatient procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for any abnormalities including polyps, diverticula and narrowing of colon structures. A significant amount of the clinician's time is spent in post-processing snapshots taken during the colonoscopy procedure, for maintaining medical records or further investigation. Automating this step can save time and improve the efficiency of the process. In our work, we have collected a dataset of 120 colonoscopy videos and 2416 snapshots taken during the procedure, that have been annotated by experts. Further, we have developed a novel, vision-transformer based landmark detection algorithm that identifies key anatomical landmarks (the appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve/cecum landmark and rectum retroflexion) from snapshots taken during colonoscopy. Our algorithm uses an adaptive gamma correction during preprocessing to maintain a consistent brightness for all images. We then use a vision transformer as the feature extraction backbone and a fully connected network based classifier head to categorize a given frame into four classes: the three landmarks or a non-landmark frame. We compare the vision transformer (ViT-B/16) backbone with ResNet-101 and ConvNext-B backbones that have been trained similarly. We report an accuracy of 82% with the vision transformer backbone on a test dataset of snapshots.

 - **Abstract**
 Compression plays an important role on the efficient transmission and storage of images and videos through band-limited systems such as streaming services, virtual reality or videogames. However, compression unavoidably leads to artifacts and the loss of the original information, which may severely degrade the visual quality. For these reasons, quality enhancement of compressed images has become a popular research topic. While most state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, other transformers-based methods such as SwinIR, show impressive performance on these tasks. In this paper, we explore the novel Swin Transformer V2, to improve SwinIR for image super-resolution, and in particular, the compressed input scenario. Using this method we can tackle the major issues in training transformer vision models, such as training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on data. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: JPEG compression artifacts removal, image super-resolution (classical and lightweight), and compressed image super-resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, Swin2SR, can improve the training convergence and performance of SwinIR, and is a top-5 solution at the "AIM 2022 Challenge on Super-Resolution of Compressed Image and Video".

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated architecture engineering method for deep learning design automation, which serves as an alternative to the manual and error-prone process of model development, selection, evaluation and performance estimation. However, one major obstacle of NAS is the extremely demanding computation resource requirements and time-consuming iterations particularly when the dataset scales. In this paper, targeting at the emerging vision transformer (ViT), we present NasHD, a hyperdimensional computing based supervised learning model to rank the performance given the architectures and configurations. Different from other learning based methods, NasHD is faster thanks to the high parallel processing of HDC architecture. We also evaluated two HDC encoding schemes: Gram-based and Record-based of NasHD on their performance and efficiency. On the VIMER-UFO benchmark dataset of 8 applications from a diverse range of domains, NasHD Record can rank the performance of nearly 100K vision transformer models with about 1 minute while still achieving comparable results with sophisticated models.

 - **Abstract**
 Timely and accurate detection of anomalies in power electronics is becoming increasingly critical for maintaining complex production systems. Robust and explainable strategies help decrease system downtime and preempt or mitigate infrastructure cyberattacks. This work begins by explaining the types of uncertainty present in current datasets and machine learning algorithm outputs. Three techniques for combating these uncertainties are then introduced and analyzed. We further present two anomaly detection and classification approaches, namely the Matrix Profile algorithm and anomaly transformer, which are applied in the context of a power electronic converter dataset. Specifically, the Matrix Profile algorithm is shown to be well suited as a generalizable approach for detecting real-time anomalies in streaming time-series data. The STUMPY python library implementation of the iterative Matrix Profile is used for the creation of the detector. A series of custom filters is created and added to the detector to tune its sensitivity, recall, and detection accuracy. Our numerical results show that, with simple parameter tuning, the detector provides high accuracy and performance in a variety of fault scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices has shown to be achievable with lightweight neural models learned from data generated by the user's inertial measurement units (IMUs). Most approaches for instanced-based HAR have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), or a combination of the two to achieve state-of-the-art results with real-time performances. Recently, the Transformers architecture in the language processing domain and then in the vision domain has pushed further the state-of-the-art over classical architectures. However, such Transformers architecture is heavyweight in computing resources, which is not well suited for embedded applications of HAR that can be found in the pervasive computing domain. In this study, we present Human Activity Recognition Transformer (HART), a lightweight, sensor-wise transformer architecture that has been specifically adapted to the domain of the IMUs embedded on mobile devices. Our experiments on HAR tasks with several publicly available datasets show that HART uses fewer FLoating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) and parameters while outperforming current state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we present evaluations across various architectures on their performances in heterogeneous environments and show that our models can better generalize on different sensing devices or on-body positions.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of detecting a novel class at run time is known as Open Set Detection & is important for various real-world applications like medical application, autonomous driving, etc. Open Set Detection within context of deep learning involves solving two problems: (i) Must map the input images into a latent representation that contains enough information to detect the outliers, and (ii) Must learn an anomaly scoring function that can extract this information from the latent representation to identify the anomalies. Research in deep anomaly detection methods has progressed slowly. One reason may be that most papers simultaneously introduce new representation learning techniques and new anomaly scoring approaches. The goal of this work is to improve this methodology by providing ways of separately measuring the effectiveness of the representation learning and anomaly scoring. This work makes two methodological contributions. The first is to introduce the notion of Oracle anomaly detection for quantifying the information available in a learned latent representation. The second is to introduce Oracle representation learning, which produces a representation that is guaranteed to be sufficient for accurate anomaly detection. These two techniques help researchers to separate the quality of the learned representation from the performance of the anomaly scoring mechanism so that they can debug and improve their systems. The methods also provide an upper limit on how much open category detection can be improved through better anomaly scoring mechanisms. The combination of the two oracles gives an upper limit on the performance that any open category detection method could achieve. This work introduces these two oracle techniques and demonstrates their utility by applying them to several leading open category detection methods.
### LEADER: Learning Attention over Driving Behaviors for Planning under  Uncertainty

 - **Abstract**
 Uncertainty on human behaviors poses a significant challenge to autonomous driving in crowded urban environments. The partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under uncertainty, often leveraging Monte Carlo sampling to achieve online performance for complex tasks. However, sampling also raises safety concerns by potentially missing critical events. To address this, we propose a new algorithm, LEarning Attention over Driving bEhavioRs (LEADER), that learns to attend to critical human behaviors during planning. LEADER learns a neural network generator to provide attention over human behaviors in real-time situations. It integrates the attention into a belief-space planner, using importance sampling to bias reasoning towards critical events. To train the algorithm, we let the attention generator and the planner form a min-max game. By solving the min-max game, LEADER learns to perform risk-aware planning without human labeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale place recognition is a fundamental but challenging task, which plays an increasingly important role in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods have achieved acceptable good performance, however, most of them are concentrating on designing elaborate global descriptor learning network structures. The importance of feature generalization and descriptor post-enhancing has long been neglected. In this work, we propose a novel method named GIDP to learn a Good Initialization and Inducing Descriptor Poseenhancing for Large-scale Place Recognition. In particular, an unsupervised momentum contrast point cloud pretraining module and a reranking-based descriptor post-enhancing module are proposed respectively in GIDP. The former aims at learning a good initialization for the point cloud encoding network before training the place recognition model, while the later aims at post-enhancing the predicted global descriptor through reranking at inference time. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance using simple and general point cloud encoding backbones.
### Query-based Hard-Image Retrieval for Object Detection at Test Time

 - **Abstract**
 There is a longstanding interest in capturing the error behaviour of object detectors by finding images where their performance is likely to be unsatisfactory. In real-world applications such as autonomous driving, it is also crucial to characterise potential failures beyond simple requirements of detection performance. For example, a missed detection of a pedestrian close to an ego vehicle will generally require closer inspection than a missed detection of a car in the distance. The problem of predicting such potential failures at test time has largely been overlooked in the literature and conventional approaches based on detection uncertainty fall short in that they are agnostic to such fine-grained characterisation of errors. In this work, we propose to reformulate the problem of finding "hard" images as a query-based hard image retrieval task, where queries are specific definitions of "hardness", and offer a simple and intuitive method that can solve this task for a large family of queries. Our method is entirely post-hoc, does not require ground-truth annotations, is independent of the choice of a detector, and relies on an efficient Monte Carlo estimation that uses a simple stochastic model in place of the ground-truth. We show experimentally that it can be applied successfully to a wide variety of queries for which it can reliably identify hard images for a given detector without any labelled data. We provide results on ranking and classification tasks using the widely used RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN, Mask-RCNN, and Cascade Mask-RCNN object detectors.
