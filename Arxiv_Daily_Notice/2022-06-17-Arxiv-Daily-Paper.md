 - **Abstract**
 The visual world can be parsimoniously characterized in terms of distinct entities with sparse interactions. Discovering this compositional structure in dynamic visual scenes has proven challenging for end-to-end computer vision approaches unless explicit instance-level supervision is provided. Slot-based models leveraging motion cues have recently shown great promise in learning to represent, segment, and track objects without direct supervision, but they still fail to scale to complex real-world multi-object videos. In an effort to bridge this gap, we take inspiration from human development and hypothesize that information about scene geometry in the form of depth signals can facilitate object-centric learning. We introduce SAVi++, an object-centric video model which is trained to predict depth signals from a slot-based video representation. By further leveraging best practices for model scaling, we are able to train SAVi++ to segment complex dynamic scenes recorded with moving cameras, containing both static and moving objects of diverse appearance on naturalistic backgrounds, without the need for segmentation supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that by using sparse depth signals obtained from LiDAR, SAVi++ is able to learn emergent object segmentation and tracking from videos in the real-world Waymo Open dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Building 3D perception systems for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on LiDAR is a critical research problem because of the high expense of LiDAR systems compared to cameras and other sensors. Current methods use multi-view RGB data collected from cameras around the vehicle and neurally "lift" features from the perspective images to the 2D ground plane, yielding a "bird's eye view" (BEV) feature representation of the 3D space around the vehicle. Recent research focuses on the way the features are lifted from images to the BEV plane. We instead propose a simple baseline model, where the "lifting" step simply averages features from all projected image locations, and find that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in BEV vehicle segmentation. Our ablations show that batch size, data augmentation, and input resolution play a large part in performance. Additionally, we reconsider the utility of radar input, which has previously been either ignored or found non-helpful by recent works. With a simple RGB-radar fusion module, we obtain a sizable boost in performance, approaching the accuracy of a LiDAR-enabled system.

 - **Abstract**
 Unlike RGB cameras that use visible light bands (384$\sim$769 THz) and Lidar that use infrared bands (361$\sim$331 THz), Radars use relatively longer wavelength radio bands (77$\sim$81 GHz), resulting in robust measurements in adverse weathers. Unfortunately, existing Radar datasets only contain a relatively small number of samples compared to the existing camera and Lidar datasets. This may hinder the development of sophisticated data-driven deep learning techniques for Radar-based perception. Moreover, most of the existing Radar datasets only provide 3D Radar tensor (3DRT) data that contain power measurements along the Doppler, range, and azimuth dimensions. As there is no elevation information, it is challenging to estimate the 3D bounding box of an object from 3DRT. In this work, we introduce KAIST-Radar (K-Radar), a novel large-scale object detection dataset and benchmark that contains 35K frames of 4D Radar tensor (4DRT) data with power measurements along the Doppler, range, azimuth, and elevation dimensions, together with carefully annotated 3D bounding box labels of objects on the roads. K-Radar includes challenging driving conditions such as adverse weathers (fog, rain, and snow) on various road structures (urban, suburban roads, alleyways, and highways). In addition to the 4DRT, we provide auxiliary measurements from carefully calibrated high-resolution Lidars, surround stereo cameras, and RTK-GPS. We also provide 4DRT-based object detection baseline neural networks (baseline NNs) and show that the height information is crucial for 3D object detection. And by comparing the baseline NN with a similarly-structured Lidar-based neural network, we demonstrate that 4D Radar is a more robust sensor for adverse weather conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Roof-mounted spinning LiDAR sensors are widely used by autonomous vehicles, driving the need for real-time processing of 3D point sequences. However, most LiDAR semantic segmentation datasets and algorithms split these acquisitions into $360^\circ$ frames, leading to acquisition latency that is incompatible with realistic real-time applications and evaluations. We address this issue with two key contributions. First, we introduce HelixNet, a $10$ billion point dataset with fine-grained labels, timestamps, and sensor rotation information that allows an accurate assessment of real-time readiness of segmentation algorithms. Second, we propose Helix4D, a compact and efficient spatio-temporal transformer architecture specifically designed for rotating LiDAR point sequences. Helix4D operates on acquisition slices that correspond to a fraction of a full rotation of the sensor, significantly reducing the total latency. We present an extensive benchmark of the performance and real-time readiness of several state-of-the-art models on HelixNet and SemanticKITTI. Helix4D reaches accuracy on par with the best segmentation algorithms with a reduction of more than $5\times$ in terms of latency and $50\times$ in model size.

### FWD: Real-time Novel View Synthesis with Forward Warping and Depth

 - **Abstract**
 Novel view synthesis (NVS) is a challenging task requiring systems to generate photorealistic images of scenes from new viewpoints, where both quality and speed are important for applications. Previous image-based rendering (IBR) methods are fast, but have poor quality when input views are sparse. Recent Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and generalizable variants give impressive results but are not real-time. In our paper, we propose a generalizable NVS method with sparse inputs, called FWD, which gives high-quality synthesis in real-time. With explicit depth and differentiable rendering, it achieves competitive results to the SOTA methods with 130-1000x speedup and better perceptual quality. If available, we can seamlessly integrate sensor depth during either training or inference to improve image quality while retaining real-time speed. With the growing prevalence of depths sensors, we hope that methods making use of depth will become increasingly useful.

 - **Abstract**
 Capitalizing on the recent advances in image generation models, existing controllable face image synthesis methods are able to generate high-fidelity images with some levels of controllability, e.g., controlling the shapes, expressions, textures, and poses of the generated face images. However, these methods focus on 2D image generative models, which are prone to producing inconsistent face images under large expression and pose changes. In this paper, we propose a new NeRF-based conditional 3D face synthesis framework, which enables 3D controllability over the generated face images by imposing explicit 3D conditions from 3D face priors. At its core is a conditional Generative Occupancy Field (cGOF) that effectively enforces the shape of the generated face to commit to a given 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) mesh. To achieve accurate control over fine-grained 3D face shapes of the synthesized image, we additionally incorporate a 3D landmark loss as well as a volume warping loss into our synthesis algorithm. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to generate high-fidelity face images and shows more precise 3D controllability than state-of-the-art 2D-based controllable face synthesis methods.

### Deep Learning and Handheld Augmented Reality Based System for Optimal  Data Collection in Fault Diagnostics Domain

 - **Abstract**
 Compared to current AI or robotic systems, humans navigate their environment with ease, making tasks such as data collection trivial. However, humans find it harder to model complex relationships hidden in the data. AI systems, especially deep learning (DL) algorithms, impressively capture those complex relationships. Symbiotically coupling humans and computational machines' strengths can simultaneously minimize the collected data required and build complex input-to-output mapping models. This paper enables this coupling by presenting a novel human-machine interaction framework to perform fault diagnostics with minimal data. Collecting data for diagnosing faults for complex systems is difficult and time-consuming. Minimizing the required data will increase the practicability of data-driven models in diagnosing faults. The framework provides instructions to a human user to collect data that mitigates the difference between the data used to train and test the fault diagnostics model. The framework is composed of three components: (1) a reinforcement learning algorithm for data collection to develop a training dataset, (2) a deep learning algorithm for diagnosing faults, and (3) a handheld augmented reality application for data collection for testing data. The proposed framework has provided above 100\% precision and recall on a novel dataset with only one instance of each fault condition. Additionally, a usability study was conducted to gauge the user experience of the handheld augmented reality application, and all users were able to follow the provided steps.
### DreamNet: A Deep Riemannian Network based on SPD Manifold Learning for  Visual Classification

 - **Abstract**
 Image set-based visual classification methods have achieved remarkable performance, via characterising the image set in terms of a non-singular covariance matrix on a symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. To adapt to complicated visual scenarios better, several Riemannian networks (RiemNets) for SPD matrix nonlinear processing have recently been studied. However, it is pertinent to ask, whether greater accuracy gains can be achieved by simply increasing the depth of RiemNets. The answer appears to be negative, as deeper RiemNets tend to lose generalization ability. To explore a possible solution to this issue, we propose a new architecture for SPD matrix learning. Specifically, to enrich the deep representations, we adopt SPDNet [1] as the backbone, with a stacked Riemannian autoencoder (SRAE) built on the tail. The associated reconstruction error term can make the embedding functions of both SRAE and of each RAE an approximate identity mapping, which helps to prevent the degradation of statistical information. We then insert several residual-like blocks with shortcut connections to augment the representational capacity of SRAE, and to simplify the training of a deeper network. The experimental evidence demonstrates that our DreamNet can achieve improved accuracy with increased depth of the network.
### Balancing Discriminability and Transferability for Source-Free Domain  Adaptation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08009
 - **Abstract**
 Conventional domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to improve domain transferability by learning domain-invariant representations; while concurrently preserving the task-discriminability knowledge gathered from the labeled source data. However, the requirement of simultaneous access to labeled source and unlabeled target renders them unsuitable for the challenging source-free DA setting. The trivial solution of realizing an effective original to generic domain mapping improves transferability but degrades task discriminability. Upon analyzing the hurdles from both theoretical and empirical standpoints, we derive novel insights to show that a mixup between original and corresponding translated generic samples enhances the discriminability-transferability trade-off while duly respecting the privacy-oriented source-free setting. A simple but effective realization of the proposed insights on top of the existing source-free DA approaches yields state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence. Beyond single-source, we also outperform multi-source prior-arts across both classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of neural networks has revolutionized the field of motion synthesis. Yet, learning to unconditionally synthesize motions from a given distribution remains a challenging task, especially when the motions are highly diverse. We present MoDi, an unconditional generative model that synthesizes diverse motions. Our model is trained in a completely unsupervised setting from a diverse, unstructured and unlabeled motion dataset and yields a well-behaved, highly semantic latent space. The design of our model follows the prolific architecture of StyleGAN and adapts two of its key technical components into the motion domain: a set of style-codes injected into each level of the generator hierarchy and a mapping function that learns and forms a disentangled latent space. We show that despite the lack of any structure in the dataset, the latent space can be semantically clustered, and facilitates semantic editing and motion interpolation. In addition, we propose a technique to invert unseen motions into the latent space, and demonstrate latent-based motion editing operations that otherwise cannot be achieved by naive manipulation of explicit motion representations. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality that can follow the distribution of highly diverse motion datasets. Code and trained models will be released at https://sigal-raab.github.io/MoDi.

 - **Abstract**
 Strategic interactions between a group of individuals or organisations can be modelled as games played on networks, where a player's payoff depends not only on their actions but also on those of their neighbours. Inferring the network structure from observed game outcomes (equilibrium actions) is an important problem with numerous potential applications in economics and social sciences. Existing methods mostly require the knowledge of the utility function associated with the game, which is often unrealistic to obtain in real-world scenarios. We adopt a transformer-like architecture which correctly accounts for the symmetries of the problem and learns a mapping from the equilibrium actions to the network structure of the game without explicit knowledge of the utility function. We test our method on three different types of network games using both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in network structure inference and superior performance over existing methods.
### RefCrowd: Grounding the Target in Crowd with Referring Expressions

 - **Abstract**
 Crowd understanding has aroused the widespread interest in vision domain due to its important practical significance. Unfortunately, there is no effort to explore crowd understanding in multi-modal domain that bridges natural language and computer vision. Referring expression comprehension (REF) is such a representative multi-modal task. Current REF studies focus more on grounding the target object from multiple distinctive categories in general scenarios. It is difficult to applied to complex real-world crowd understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a new challenging dataset, called RefCrowd, which towards looking for the target person in crowd with referring expressions. It not only requires to sufficiently mine the natural language information, but also requires to carefully focus on subtle differences between the target and a crowd of persons with similar appearance, so as to realize the fine-grained mapping from language to vision. Furthermore, we propose a Fine-grained Multi-modal Attribute Contrastive Network (FMAC) to deal with REF in crowd understanding. It first decomposes the intricate visual and language features into attribute-aware multi-modal features, and then captures discriminative but robustness fine-grained attribute features to effectively distinguish these subtle differences between similar persons. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on our RefCrowd dataset and existing REF datasets. In addition, we implement an end-to-end REF toolbox for the deeper research in multi-modal domain. Our dataset and code can be available at: \url{https://qiuheqian.github.io/datasets/refcrowd/}.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous cooperating UAVs in search and rescue operations in subterranean domains with complex topology. The proposed system was ranked second in the Virtual Track of the DARPA SubT Finals as part of the team CTU-CRAS-NORLAB. In contrast to the winning solution that was developed specifically for the Virtual Track, the proposed solution also proved to be a robust system for deployment onboard physical UAVs flying in the extremely harsh and confined environment of the real-world competition. The proposed approach enables fully autonomous and decentralized deployment of a UAV team with seamless simulation-to-world transfer, and proves its advantage over less mobile UGV teams in the flyable space of diverse environments. The main contributions of the paper are present in the mapping and navigation pipelines. The mapping approach employs novel map representations -- SphereMap for efficient risk-aware long-distance planning, FacetMap for surface coverage, and the compressed topological-volumetric LTVMap for allowing multi-robot cooperation under low-bandwidth communication. These representations are used in navigation together with novel methods for visibility-constrained informed search in a general 3D environment with no assumptions about the environment structure, while balancing deep exploration with sensor-coverage exploitation. The proposed solution also includes a visual-perception pipeline for on-board detection and localization of objects of interest in four RGB stream at 5 Hz each without a dedicated GPU. Apart from participation in the DARPA SubT, the performance of the UAV system is supported by extensive experimental verification in diverse environments with both qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

Together with existing 3D visual assets, it supports an array of audio-visual research tasks, such as audio-visual navigation, mapping, source localization and separation, and acoustic matching. Compared to existing resources, SoundSpaces 2.0 has the advantages of allowing continuous spatial sampling, generalization to novel environments, and configurable microphone and material properties. To our best knowledge, this is the first geometry-based acoustic simulation that offers high fidelity and realism while also being fast enough to use for embodied learning. We showcase the simulator's properties and benchmark its performance against real-world audio measurements. In addition, through two downstream tasks covering embodied navigation and far-field automatic speech recognition, highlighting sim2real performance for the latter. SoundSpaces 2.0 is publicly available to facilitate wider research for perceptual systems that can both see and hear.

 - **Abstract**
 Source code repositories consist of large codebases, often containing error-prone programs. The increasing complexity of software has led to a drastic rise in time and costs for identifying and fixing these defects. Various methods exist to automatically generate fixes for buggy code. However, due to the large combinatorial space of possible solutions for a particular bug, there are not many tools and datasets available to evaluate generated code effectively. In this work, we introduce FixEval, a benchmark comprising buggy code submissions to competitive programming problems and their respective fixes. We introduce a rich test suite to evaluate and assess the correctness of model-generated program fixes. We consider two Transformer language models pretrained on programming languages as our baselines, and compare them using match-based and execution-based evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that match-based metrics do not reflect model-generated program fixes accurately, while execution-based methods evaluate programs through all cases and scenarios specifically designed for that solution. Therefore, we believe FixEval provides a step towards real-world automatic bug fixing and model-generated code evaluation.
### What makes domain generalization hard?

 - **Abstract**
 While several methodologies have been proposed for the daunting task of domain generalization, understanding what makes this task challenging has received little attention. Here we present SemanticDG (Semantic Domain Generalization): a benchmark with 15 photo-realistic domains with the same geometry, scene layout and camera parameters as the popular 3D ScanNet dataset, but with controlled domain shifts in lighting, materials, and viewpoints. Using this benchmark, we investigate the impact of each of these semantic shifts on generalization independently. Visual recognition models easily generalize to novel lighting, but struggle with distribution shifts in materials and viewpoints. Inspired by human vision, we hypothesize that scene context can serve as a bridge to help models generalize across material and viewpoint domain shifts and propose a context-aware vision transformer along with a contrastive loss over material and viewpoint changes to address these domain shifts. Our approach (dubbed as CDCNet) outperforms existing domain generalization methods by over an 18% margin. As a critical benchmark, we also conduct psychophysics experiments and find that humans generalize equally well across lighting, materials and viewpoints. The benchmark and computational model introduced here help understand the challenges associated with generalization across domains and provide initial steps towards extrapolation to semantic distribution shifts. We include all data and source code in the supplement.
### Text normalization for endangered languages: the case of Ligurian

 - **Abstract**
 Text normalization is a crucial technology for low-resource languages which lack rigid spelling conventions. Low-resource text normalization has so far relied upon hand-crafted rules, which are perceived to be more data efficient than neural methods. In this paper we examine the case of text normalization for Ligurian, an endangered Romance language. We collect 4,394 Ligurian sentences paired with their normalized versions, as well as the first monolingual corpus for Ligurian. We show that, in spite of the small amounts of data available, a compact transformer-based model can be trained to achieve very low error rates by the use of backtranslation and appropriate tokenization. Our datasets are released to the public.

 - **Abstract**
 Designed for tracking user goals in dialogues, a dialogue state tracker is an essential component in a dialogue system. However, the research of dialogue state tracking has largely been limited to unimodality, in which slots and slot values are limited by knowledge domains (e.g. restaurant domain with slots of restaurant name and price range) and are defined by specific database schema. In this paper, we propose to extend the definition of dialogue state tracking to multimodality. Specifically, we introduce a novel dialogue state tracking task to track the information of visual objects that are mentioned in video-grounded dialogues. Each new dialogue utterance may introduce a new video segment, new visual objects, or new object attributes, and a state tracker is required to update these information slots accordingly. We created a new synthetic benchmark and designed a novel baseline, Video-Dialogue Transformer Network (VDTN), for this task. VDTN combines both object-level features and segment-level features and learns contextual dependencies between videos and dialogues to generate multimodal dialogue states. We optimized VDTN for a state generation task as well as a self-supervised video understanding task which recovers video segment or object representations. Finally, we trained VDTN to use the decoded states in a response prediction task. Together with comprehensive ablation and qualitative analysis, we discovered interesting insights towards building more capable multimodal dialogue systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimodal sentiment analysis in videos is a key task in many real-world applications, which usually requires integrating multimodal streams including visual, verbal and acoustic behaviors. To improve the robustness of multimodal fusion, some of the existing methods let different modalities communicate with each other and modal the crossmodal interaction via transformers. However, these methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction but forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels of semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by transformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale cooperative multimodal transformer (MCMulT) architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis. On the whole, the "multi-scale" mechanism is capable of exploiting the different levels of semantic information of each modality which are used for fine-grained crossmodal interactions. Meanwhile, each modality learns its feature hierarchies via integrating the crossmodal interactions from multiple level features of its source modality. In this way, each pair of modalities progressively builds feature hierarchies respectively in a cooperative manner. The empirical results illustrate that our MCMulT model not only outperforms existing approaches on unaligned multimodal sequences but also has strong performance on aligned multimodal sequences.

 Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown impressive results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images. This paper aims to improve their performance further by utilizing the architectural advantages of the underlying neural network, as the current state-of-the-art visual pretext tasks for SSL do not enjoy the benefit, i.e., they are architecture-agnostic. In particular, we focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which have gained much attention recently as a better architectural choice, often outperforming convolutional networks for various visual tasks. The unique characteristic of ViT is that it takes a sequence of disjoint patches from an image and processes patch-level representations internally. Inspired by this, we design a simple yet effective visual pretext task, coined SelfPatch, for learning better patch-level representations. To be specific, we enforce invariance against each patch and its neighbors, i.e., each patch treats similar neighboring patches as positive samples. Consequently, training ViTs with SelfPatch learns more semantically meaningful relations among patches (without using human-annotated labels), which can be beneficial, in particular, to downstream tasks of a dense prediction type. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that it can significantly improve the performance of existing SSL methods for various visual tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, SelfPatch significantly improves the recent self-supervised ViT, DINO, by achieving +1.3 AP on COCO object detection, +1.2 AP on COCO instance segmentation, and +2.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 In modern NLP applications, word embeddings are a crucial backbone that can be readily shared across a number of tasks. However as the text distributions change and word semantics evolve over time, the downstream applications using the embeddings can suffer if the word representations do not conform to the data drift. Thus, maintaining word embeddings to be consistent with the underlying data distribution is a key problem. In this work, we tackle this problem and propose TransDrift, a transformer-based prediction model for word embeddings. Leveraging the flexibility of transformer, our model accurately learns the dynamics of the embedding drift and predicts the future embedding. In experiments, we compare with existing methods and show that our model makes significantly more accurate predictions of the word embedding than the baselines. Crucially, by applying the predicted embeddings as a backbone for downstream classification tasks, we show that our embeddings lead to superior performance compared to the previous methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Strategic interactions between a group of individuals or organisations can be modelled as games played on networks, where a player's payoff depends not only on their actions but also on those of their neighbours. Inferring the network structure from observed game outcomes (equilibrium actions) is an important problem with numerous potential applications in economics and social sciences. Existing methods mostly require the knowledge of the utility function associated with the game, which is often unrealistic to obtain in real-world scenarios. We adopt a transformer-like architecture which correctly accounts for the symmetries of the problem and learns a mapping from the equilibrium actions to the network structure of the game without explicit knowledge of the utility function. We test our method on three different types of network games using both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in network structure inference and superior performance over existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are based on the message passing (MP) paradigm exchange information between 1-hop neighbors to build node representations at each layer. In principle, such networks are not able to capture long-range interactions (LRI) that may be desired or necessary for learning a given task on graphs. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in development of Transformer-based methods for graphs that can consider full node connectivity beyond the original sparse structure, thus enabling the modeling of LRI. However, MP-GNNs that simply rely on 1-hop message passing often fare better in several existing graph benchmarks when combined with positional feature representations, among other innovations, hence limiting the perceived utility and ranking of Transformer-like architectures. Here, we present the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) with 5 graph learning datasets: PascalVOC-SP, COCO-SP, PCQM-Contact, Peptides-func and Peptides-struct that arguably require LRI reasoning to achieve strong performance in a given task. We benchmark both baseline GNNs and Graph Transformer networks to verify that the models which capture long-range dependencies perform significantly better on these tasks. Therefore, these datasets are suitable for benchmarking and exploration of MP-GNNs and Graph Transformer architectures that are intended to capture LRI.

 - **Abstract**
 Roof-mounted spinning LiDAR sensors are widely used by autonomous vehicles, driving the need for real-time processing of 3D point sequences. However, most LiDAR semantic segmentation datasets and algorithms split these acquisitions into $360^\circ$ frames, leading to acquisition latency that is incompatible with realistic real-time applications and evaluations. We address this issue with two key contributions. First, we introduce HelixNet, a $10$ billion point dataset with fine-grained labels, timestamps, and sensor rotation information that allows an accurate assessment of real-time readiness of segmentation algorithms. Second, we propose Helix4D, a compact and efficient spatio-temporal transformer architecture specifically designed for rotating LiDAR point sequences. Helix4D operates on acquisition slices that correspond to a fraction of a full rotation of the sensor, significantly reducing the total latency. We present an extensive benchmark of the performance and real-time readiness of several state-of-the-art models on HelixNet and SemanticKITTI. Helix4D reaches accuracy on par with the best segmentation algorithms with a reduction of more than $5\times$ in terms of latency and $50\times$ in model size.

 Visual domain adaptation (DA) seeks to transfer trained models to unseen, unlabeled domains across distribution shift, but approaches typically focus on adapting convolutional neural network architectures initialized with supervised ImageNet representations. In this work, we shift focus to adapting modern architectures for object recognition -- the increasingly popular Vision Transformer (ViT) -- and modern pretraining based on self-supervised learning (SSL). Inspired by the design of recent SSL approaches based on learning from partial image inputs generated via masking or cropping -- either by learning to predict the missing pixels, or learning representational invariances to such augmentations -- we propose PACMAC, a simple two-stage adaptation algorithm for self-supervised ViTs. PACMAC first performs in-domain SSL on pooled source and target data to learn task-discriminative features, and then probes the model's predictive consistency across a set of partial target inputs generated via a novel attention-conditioned masking strategy, to identify reliable candidates for self-training. Our simple approach leads to consistent performance gains over competing methods that use ViTs and self-supervised initializations on standard object recognition benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling long-term dependencies for audio signals is a particularly challenging problem, as even small-time scales yield on the order of a hundred thousand samples. With the recent advent of Transformers, neural architectures became good at modeling dependencies over longer time scales, but they suffered from quadratic constraints to scale them. We propose a generative auto-regressive architecture that can model audio waveforms over quite a large context, greater than 500,000 samples. Our work is adapted to learn time dependencies by learning a latent representation by a CNN front-end, and then learning dependencies over these representations using Transformer encoders, fully trained end-to-end: thereby allowing to learn representations as it deems fit for the next sample. Unlike previous works that compared different time scales to show improvement, we use a standard dataset, with the same number of parameters/context to show improvements. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance as compared to other approaches such as Wavenet, SaSHMI, and Sample-RNN on a standard dataset for modeling long-term structure. This work gives very exciting direction for the field, given improvements in context modeling that can be scaled with more data, as well as potentially better results by using billions/trillions of parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have recently dominated the ASR field. Although able to yield good performance, they involve an autoregressive (AR) decoder to generate tokens one by one, which is computationally inefficient. To speed up inference, non-autoregressive (NAR) methods, e.g. single-step NAR, were designed, to enable parallel generation. However, due to an independence assumption within the output tokens, performance of single-step NAR is inferior to that of AR models, especially with a large-scale corpus. There are two challenges to improving single-step NAR: Firstly to accurately predict the number of output tokens and extract hidden variables; secondly, to enhance modeling of interdependence between output tokens. To tackle both challenges, we propose a fast and accurate parallel transformer, termed Paraformer. This utilizes a continuous integrate-and-fire based predictor to predict the number of tokens and generate hidden variables. A glancing language model (GLM) sampler then generates semantic embeddings to enhance the NAR decoder's ability to model context interdependence. Finally, we design a strategy to generate negative samples for minimum word error rate training to further improve performance. Experiments using the public AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2 benchmark, and an industrial-level 20,000 hour task demonstrate that the proposed Paraformer can attain comparable performance to the state-of-the-art AR transformer, with more than 10x speedup.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based architectures have become competitive across a variety of visual domains, most notably images and videos. While prior work has studied these modalities in isolation, having a common architecture suggests that one can train a single unified model for multiple visual modalities. Prior attempts at unified modeling typically use architectures tailored for vision tasks, or obtain worse performance compared to single modality models. In this work, we show that masked autoencoding can be used to train a simple Vision Transformer on images and videos, without requiring any labeled data. This single model learns visual representations that are comparable to or better than single-modality representations on both image and video benchmarks, while using a much simpler architecture. In particular, our single pretrained model can be finetuned to achieve 86.5% on ImageNet and 75.3% on the challenging Something Something-v2 video benchmark. Furthermore, this model can be learned by dropping 90% of the image and 95% of the video patches, enabling extremely fast training.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been increasingly employed during the last decade to solve various decision-making problems such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, these algorithms have faced great challenges when deployed in safety-critical environments since they often exhibit erroneous behaviors that can lead to potentially critical errors. One way to assess the safety of DRL agents is to test them to detect possible faults leading to critical failures during their execution. This raises the question of how we can efficiently test DRL policies to ensure their correctness and adherence to safety requirements. Most existing works on testing DRL agents use adversarial attacks that perturb states or actions of the agent. However, such attacks often lead to unrealistic states of the environment. Their main goal is to test the robustness of DRL agents rather than testing the compliance of agents' policies with respect to requirements. Due to the huge state space of DRL environments, the high cost of test execution, and the black-box nature of DRL algorithms, the exhaustive testing of DRL agents is impossible. In this paper, we propose a Search-based Testing Approach of Reinforcement Learning Agents (STARLA) to test the policy of a DRL agent by effectively searching for failing executions of the agent within a limited testing budget. We use machine learning models and a dedicated genetic algorithm to narrow the search towards faulty episodes. We apply STARLA on a Deep-Q-Learning agent which is widely used as a benchmark and show that it significantly outperforms Random Testing by detecting more faults related to the agent's policy. We also investigate how to extract rules that characterize faulty episodes of the DRL agent using our search results. Such rules can be used to understand the conditions under which the agent fails and thus assess its deployment risks.

 - **Abstract**
 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation demonstrates great potential to mitigate domain shifts by transferring models from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been applied to a wide variety of complex vision tasks, only few works focus on lane detection for autonomous driving. This can be attributed to the lack of publicly available datasets. To facilitate research in these directions, we propose CARLANE, a 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection. CARLANE encompasses the single-target datasets MoLane and TuLane and the multi-target dataset MuLane. These datasets are built from three different domains, which cover diverse scenes and contain a total of 163K unique images, 118K of which are annotated. In addition we evaluate and report systematic baselines, including our own method, which builds upon Prototypical Cross-domain Self-supervised Learning. We find that false positive and false negative rates of the evaluated domain adaptation methods are high compared to those of fully supervised baselines. This affirms the need for benchmarks such as CARLANE to further strengthen research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for lane detection. CARLANE, all evaluated models and the corresponding implementations are publicly available at https://carlanebenchmark.github.io.

 - **Abstract**
 Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods either run a controller based on a planned trajectory or perform control prediction directly, which have spanned two separately studied lines of research. Seeing their potential mutual benefits to each other, this paper takes the initiative to explore the combination of these two well-developed worlds. Specifically, our integrated approach has two branches for trajectory planning and direct control, respectively. The trajectory branch predicts the future trajectory, while the control branch involves a novel multi-step prediction scheme such that the relationship between current actions and future states can be reasoned. The two branches are connected so that the control branch receives corresponding guidance from the trajectory branch at each time step. The outputs from two branches are then fused to achieve complementary advantages. Our results are evaluated in the closed-loop urban driving setting with challenging scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Even with a monocular camera input, the proposed approach ranks $first$ on the official CARLA Leaderboard, outperforming other complex candidates with multiple sensors or fusion mechanisms by a large margin. The source code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/TCP.

 - **Abstract**
 Equipped with a wide span of sensors, predominant autonomous driving solutions are becoming more modular-oriented for safe system design. Though these sensors have laid a solid foundation, most massive-production solutions up to date still fall into L2 phase. Among these, Comma.ai comes to our sight, claiming one $999 aftermarket device mounted with a single camera and board inside owns the ability to handle L2 scenarios. Together with open-sourced software of the entire system released by Comma.ai, the project is named Openpilot. Is it possible? If so, how is it made possible? With curiosity in mind, we deep-dive into Openpilot and conclude that its key to success is the end-to-end system design instead of a conventional modular framework. The model is briefed as Supercombo, and it can predict the ego vehicle's future trajectory and other road semantics on the fly from monocular input. Unfortunately, the training process and massive amount of data to make all these work are not publicly available. To achieve an intensive investigation, we try to reimplement the training details and test the pipeline on public benchmarks. The refactored network proposed in this work is referred to as OP-Deepdive. For a fair comparison of our version to the original Supercombo, we introduce a dual-model deployment scheme to test the driving performance in the real world. Experimental results on nuScenes, Comma2k19, CARLA, and in-house realistic scenarios verify that a low-cost device can indeed achieve most L2 functionalities and be on par with the original Supercombo model. In this report, we would like to share our latest findings, shed some light on the new perspective of end-to-end autonomous driving from an industrial product-level side, and potentially inspire the community to continue improving the performance. Our code, benchmarks are at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/Openpilot-Deepdive.

 Adapting to a continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably faced by all autonomous driving systems. Existing image and video driving datasets, however, fall short of capturing the mutable nature of the real world. In this paper, we introduce the largest multi-task synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, SHIFT. It presents discrete and continuous shifts in cloudiness, rain and fog intensity, time of day, and vehicle and pedestrian density. Featuring a comprehensive sensor suite and annotations for several mainstream perception tasks, SHIFT allows investigating the degradation of a perception system performance at increasing levels of domain shift, fostering the development of continuous adaptation strategies to mitigate this problem and assess model robustness and generality. Our dataset and benchmark toolkit are publicly available at www.vis.xyz/shift.
