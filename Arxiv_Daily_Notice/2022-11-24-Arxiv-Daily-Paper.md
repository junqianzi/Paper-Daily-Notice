 A high-quality 3D reconstruction of a scene from a collection of 2D images can be achieved through offline/online mapping methods. In this paper, we explore active mapping from the perspective of implicit representations, which have recently produced compelling results in a variety of applications. One of the most popular implicit representations - Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), first demonstrated photorealistic rendering results using multi-layer perceptrons, with promising offline 3D reconstruction as a by-product of the radiance field. More recently, researchers also applied this implicit representation for online reconstruction and localization (i.e. implicit SLAM systems). However, the study on using implicit representation for active vision tasks is still very limited. In this paper, we are particularly interested in applying the neural radiance field for active mapping and planning problems, which are closely coupled tasks in an active system. We, for the first time, present an RGB-only active vision framework using radiance field representation for active 3D reconstruction and planning in an online manner. Specifically, we formulate this joint task as an iterative dual-stage optimization problem, where we alternatively optimize for the radiance field representation and path planning. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to other offline methods and outperforms active reconstruction methods using NeRFs.

 - **Abstract**
 Place recognition based on point cloud (LiDAR) scans is an important module for achieving robust autonomy in robots or self-driving vehicles. Training deep networks to match such scans presents a difficult trade-off: a higher spatial resolution of the network's intermediate representations is needed to perform fine-grained matching of subtle geometric features, but growing it too large makes the memory requirements infeasible. In this work, we propose a Point-Voxel Transformer network (PVT3D) that achieves robust fine-grained matching with low memory requirements. It leverages a sparse voxel branch to extract and aggregate information at a lower resolution and a point-wise branch to obtain fine-grained local information. A novel hierarchical cross-attention transformer (HCAT) uses queries from one branch to try to match structures in the other branch, ensuring that both extract self-contained descriptors of the point cloud (rather than one branch dominating), but using both to inform the output global descriptor of the point cloud. Extensive experiments show that the proposed PVT3D method surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large amount on several datasets (Oxford RobotCar, TUM, USyd). For instance, we achieve AR@1 of 85.6% on the TUM dataset, which surpasses the strongest prior model by ~15%.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliance on vast annotations to achieve leading performance severely restricts the practicality of large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. For the purpose of reducing data annotation costs, effective labeling schemes are developed and contribute to attaining competitive results under weak supervision strategy. Revisiting current weak label forms, we introduce One Class One Click (OCOC), a low cost yet informative quasi scene-level label, which encapsulates point-level and scene-level annotations. An active weakly supervised framework is proposed to leverage scarce labels by involving weak supervision from global and local perspectives. Contextual constraints are imposed by an auxiliary scene classification task, respectively based on global feature embedding and point-wise prediction aggregation, which restricts the model prediction merely to OCOC labels. Furthermore, we design a context-aware pseudo labeling strategy, which effectively supplement point-level supervisory signals. Finally, an active learning scheme with a uncertainty measure - temporal output discrepancy is integrated to examine informative samples and provides guidance on sub-clouds query, which is conducive to quickly attaining desirable OCOC annotations and reduces the labeling cost to an extremely low extent. Extensive experimental analysis using three LiDAR benchmarks collected from airborne, mobile and ground platforms demonstrates that our proposed method achieves very promising results though subject to scarce labels. It considerably outperforms genuine scene-level weakly supervised methods by up to 25\% in terms of average F1 score and achieves competitive results against full supervision schemes. On terrestrial LiDAR dataset - Semantics3D, using approximately 2\textpertenthousand{} of labels, our method achieves an average F1 score of 85.2\%, which increases by 11.58\% compared to the baseline model.

 - **Abstract**
 Many existing datasets for lidar place recognition are solely representative of structured urban environments, and have recently been saturated in performance by deep learning based approaches. Natural and unstructured environments present many additional challenges for the tasks of long-term localisation but these environments are not represented in currently available datasets. To address this we introduce Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 67K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. Our dataset contains multiple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e. loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e. re-localisation) place recognition. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time. Our dataset and code will be available at https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR-produced point clouds are the major source for most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. Yet, small, distant, and incomplete objects with sparse or few points are often hard to detect. We present Sparse2Dense, a new framework to efficiently boost 3D detection performance by learning to densify point clouds in latent space. Specifically, we first train a dense point 3D detector (DDet) with a dense point cloud as input and design a sparse point 3D detector (SDet) with a regular point cloud as input. Importantly, we formulate the lightweight plug-in S2D module and the point cloud reconstruction module in SDet to densify 3D features and train SDet to produce 3D features, following the dense 3D features in DDet. So, in inference, SDet can simulate dense 3D features from regular (sparse) point cloud inputs without requiring dense inputs. We evaluate our method on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and the Waymo Domain Adaptation Dataset, showing its high performance and efficiency over the state of the arts.

 - **Abstract**
 Tactile sensors have been introduced to a wide range of robotic tasks such as robot manipulation to mimic the sense of human touch. However, there has only been a few works that integrate tactile sensing into robot navigation. This paper describes a navigation system which allows robots to operate in crowded human-dense environments and behave with socially acceptable reactions by utilizing semantic and force information collected by embedded tactile sensors, RGB-D camera and LiDAR. Compliance control is implemented based on artificial potential fields considering not only laser scan but also force reading from tactile sensors which promises a fast and reliable response to any possible collision. In contrast to cameras, LiDAR and other non-contact sensors, tactile sensors can directly interact with humans and can be used to accept social cues akin to natural human behavior under the same situation. Furthermore, leveraging semantic segmentation from vision module, the robot is able to identify and, therefore assign varying social cost to different groups of humans enabling for socially conscious path planning. At the end of this paper, the proposed control strategy was validated successfully by testing several scenarios on an omni-directional robot in real world.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Zero-NeRF, a projective surface registration method that, to the best of our knowledge, offers the first general solution capable of alignment between scene representations with minimal or zero visual correspondence. To do this, we enforce consistency between visible surfaces of partial and complete reconstructions, which allows us to constrain occluded geometry. We use a NeRF as our surface representation and the NeRF rendering pipeline to perform this alignment. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we register real-world scenes from opposite sides with infinitesimal overlaps that cannot be accurately registered using prior methods, and we compare these results against widely used registration methods.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12758
 - **Abstract**
 The method of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has been developed in recent years, and this technology has promising applications for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. However, NeRF requires dense input views, typically numbering in the hundreds, for generating high-quality images. With a decrease in the number of input views, the rendering quality of NeRF for unseen viewpoints tends to degenerate drastically. To overcome this challenge, we propose pseudo-view augmentation of NeRF, a scheme that expands a sufficient amount of data by considering the geometry of few-shot inputs. We first initialized the NeRF network by leveraging the expanded pseudo-views, which efficiently minimizes uncertainty when rendering unseen views. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the network by utilizing sparse-view inputs containing precise geometry and color information. Through experiments under various settings, we verified that our model faithfully synthesizes novel-view images of superior quality and outperforms existing methods for multi-view datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have received considerable attention recently, due to its impressive capability in photo-realistic 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, given a set of posed camera images. Earlier work usually assumes the input images are in good quality. However, image degradation (e.g. image motion blur in low-light conditions) can easily happen in real-world scenarios, which would further affect the rendering quality of NeRF. In this paper, we present a novel bundle adjusted deblur Neural Radiance Fields (BAD-NeRF), which can be robust to severe motion blurred images and inaccurate camera poses. Our approach models the physical image formation process of a motion blurred image, and jointly learns the parameters of NeRF and recovers the camera motion trajectories during exposure time. In experiments, we show that by directly modeling the real physical image formation process, BAD-NeRF achieves superior performance over prior works on both synthetic and real datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 With NeRF widely used for facial reenactment, recent methods can recover photo-realistic 3D head avatar from just a monocular video. Unfortunately, the training process of the NeRF-based methods is quite time-consuming, as MLP used in the NeRF-based methods is inefficient and requires too many iterations to converge. To overcome this problem, we propose ManVatar, a fast 3D head avatar reconstruction method using Motion-Aware Neural Voxels. ManVatar is the first to decouple expression motion from canonical appearance for head avatar, and model the expression motion by neural voxels. In particular, the motion-aware neural voxels is generated from the weighted concatenation of multiple 4D tensors. The 4D tensors semantically correspond one-to-one with 3DMM expression bases and share the same weights as 3DMM expression coefficients. Benefiting from our novel representation, the proposed ManVatar can recover photo-realistic head avatars in just 5 minutes (implemented with pure PyTorch), which is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art facial reenactment methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Physical simulations produce excellent predictions of weather effects. Neural radiance fields produce SOTA scene models. We describe a novel NeRF-editing procedure that can fuse physical simulations with NeRF models of scenes, producing realistic movies of physical phenomena inthose scenes. Our application -- Climate NeRF -- allows people to visualize what climate change outcomes will do to them. ClimateNeRF allows us to render realistic weather effects, including smog, snow, and flood. Results can be controlled with physically meaningful variables like water level. Qualitative and quantitative studies show that our simulated results are significantly more realistic than those from state-of-the-art 2D image editing and 3D NeRF stylization.

### Rate-Splitting Enabled Multi-Connectivity in Mixed-Criticality Systems

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12528
 - **Abstract**
 The enormous quality of service (QoS) demands posed by mission-critical use-cases of future 5G/6G wireless communication raise the need for resource-efficient highly reliable and low latency connectivity solutions. Multi-connectivity is considered a promising yet resource demanding approach to enhance reliability. In this work, we study the potential of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework as an efficient way to enable uplink multi-connectivity for data transmissions with particularly high reliability requirements. Mapping high-criticality data onto the common stream allows it to be decoded at multiple access points (APs), which enhances reliability, while the private stream is utilized to serve applications with less stringent requirements. We propose a criticality-aware RSMA-based transmission scheme with short blocklength coding and derive an iterative power allocation algorithm by means of successive convex approximation (SCA). The proposed scheme is shown to achieve an expanded stability rate region compared to two baseline schemes. Moreover, it turns out to be less impacted by short blocklength while leading to substantial rate gains, particularly in the high SNR regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a robotic learning system for autonomous exploration and navigation in unexplored environments. We are motivated by the idea that even an unseen environment may be familiar from previous experiences in similar environments. The core of our method, therefore, is a process for building, predicting, and using probabilistic layout graphs for assisting goal-based visual navigation. We describe a navigation system that uses the layout predictions to satisfy high-level goals (e.g. "go to the kitchen") more rapidly and accurately than the prior art. Our proposed navigation framework comprises three stages: (1) Perception and Mapping: building a multi-level 3D scene graph; (2) Prediction: predicting probabilistic 3D scene graph for the unexplored environment; (3) Navigation: assisting navigation with the graphs. We test our framework in Matterport3D and show more success and efficient navigation in unseen environments.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper develops a low-complexity near-optimal non-coherent receiver for a multi-level energy-based coded modulation system. Inspired by the turbo processing principle, we incorporate the fundamentals of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) into the proposed receiver design. The resulting system is called bit-interleaved coded energy-based modulation with iterative decoding (BICEM-ID) and its error performance is analytically studied. Specifically, we derive upper bounds on the average pairwise error probability (PEP) of the non-coherent BICEM-ID system in the feedback-free (FF) and error-free feedback (EFF) scenarios. It is revealed that the definition of the nearest neighbors, which is important in the performance analysis in the FF scenario, is very different from that in the coherent BICM-ID counterpart. The analysis also reveals how the mapping from coded bits to energy levels influences the diversity order and coding gain of the BICEM-ID systems. A design criterion for good mappings is then formulated and an algorithm is proposed to find a set of best mappings for BICEM-ID. Finally, simulation results corroborate the main analytical findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Lensless imaging can provide visual privacy due to the highly multiplexed characteristic of its measurements. However, this alone is a weak form of security, as various adversarial attacks can be designed to invert the one-to-many scene mapping of such cameras. In this work, we enhance the privacy provided by lensless imaging by (1) downsampling at the sensor and (2) using a programmable mask with variable patterns as our optical encoder. We build a prototype from a low-cost LCD and Raspberry Pi components, for a total cost of around 100 USD. This very low price point allows our system to be deployed and leveraged in a broad range of applications. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the viability and reconfigurability of our system by applying it to various classification tasks: MNIST, CelebA (face attributes), and CIFAR10. By jointly optimizing the mask pattern and a digital classifier in an end-to-end fashion, low-dimensional, privacy-enhancing embeddings are learned directly at the sensor. Secondly, we show how the proposed system, through variable mask patterns, can thwart adversaries that attempt to invert the system (1) via plaintext attacks or (2) in the event of camera parameters leaks. We demonstrate the defense of our system to both risks, with 55% and 26% drops in image quality metrics for attacks based on model-based convex optimization and generative neural networks respectively. We open-source a wave propagation and camera simulator needed for end-to-end optimization, the training software, and a library for interfacing with the camera.

 - **Abstract**
 The demand for computation resources and energy efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applications requires a new paradigm to overcome the "Memory Wall". Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) is a promising paradigm since it performs matrix-vector multiplications, the critical kernel of many ML applications, in-place in the analog domain within memory arrays structured as crossbars of memory cells. However, several factors limit the full exploitation of this technology, including the physical fabrication of the crossbar devices, which constrain the memory capacity of a single array. Multi-AIMC architectures have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but they have been demonstrated only for tiny and custom CNNs or performing some layers off-chip. In this work, we present the full inference of an end-to-end ResNet-18 DNN on a 512-cluster heterogeneous architecture coupling a mix of AIMC cores and digital RISC-V cores, achieving up to 20.2 TOPS. Moreover, we analyze the mapping of the network on the available non-volatile cells, compare it with state-of-the-art models, and derive guidelines for next-generation many-core architectures based on AIMC devices.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data is a key challenge in federated learning (FL), which usually hampers the optimization convergence and the performance of FL. Existing data augmentation methods based on federated generative models or raw data sharing strategies for solving the non-IID problem still suffer from low performance, privacy protection concerns, and high communication overhead in decentralized tabular data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated tabular data augmentation method, named Fed-TDA. The core idea of Fed-TDA is to synthesize tabular data for data augmentation using some simple statistics (e.g., distributions of each column and global covariance). Specifically, we propose the multimodal distribution transformation and inverse cumulative distribution mapping respectively synthesize continuous and discrete columns in tabular data from a noise according to the pre-learned statistics. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze that our Fed-TDA not only preserves data privacy but also maintains the distribution of the original data and the correlation between columns. Through extensive experiments on five real-world tabular datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of Fed-TDA over the state-of-the-art in test performance and communication efficiency.

### Image Anomaly Detection and Localization with Position and Neighborhood  Information

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12634
 - **Abstract**
 Anomaly detection and localization are essential in many areas, where collecting enough anomalous samples for training is almost impossible. To overcome this difficulty, many existing methods use a pre-trained network to encode input images and non-parametric modeling to estimate the encoded feature distribution. In the modeling process, however, they overlook that position and neighborhood information affect the distribution of normal features. To use the information, in this paper, the normal distribution is estimated with conditional probability given neighborhood features, which is modeled with a multi-layer perceptron network. At the same time, positional information can be used by building a histogram of representative features at each position. While existing methods simply resize the anomaly map into the resolution of an input image, the proposed method uses an additional refine network that is trained from synthetic anomaly images to perform better interpolation considering the shape and edge of the input image. For the popular industrial dataset, MVTec AD benchmark, the experimental results show \textbf{99.52\%} and \textbf{98.91\%} AUROC scores in anomaly detection and localization, which is state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a fast and principled approach for solving the visual anomaly detection and segmentation problem. In this setup, we have access to only anomaly-free training data and want to detect and identify anomalies of an arbitrary nature on test data. We propose the application of linear statistical dimensionality reduction techniques on the intermediate features produced by a pretrained DNN on the training data, in order to capture the low-dimensional subspace truly spanned by said features. We show that the \emph{feature reconstruction error} (FRE), which is the $\ell_2$-norm of the difference between the original feature in the high-dimensional space and the pre-image of its low-dimensional reduced embedding, is extremely effective for anomaly detection. Further, using the same feature reconstruction error concept on intermediate convolutional layers, we derive FRE maps that provide pixel-level spatial localization of the anomalies in the image (i.e. segmentation). Experiments using standard anomaly detection datasets and DNN architectures demonstrate that our method matches or exceeds best-in-class quality performance, but at a fraction of the computational and memory cost required by the state of the art. It can be trained and run very efficiently, even on a traditional CPU.

 - **Abstract**
 Video copy localization aims to precisely localize all the copied segments within a pair of untrimmed videos in video retrieval applications. Previous methods typically start from frame-to-frame similarity matrix generated by cosine similarity between frame-level features of the input video pair, and then detect and refine the boundaries of copied segments on similarity matrix under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose TransVCL: an attention-enhanced video copy localization network, which is optimized directly from initial frame-level features and trained end-to-end with three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for similarity matrix generation, and a temporal alignment module for copied segments localization. In contrast to previous methods demanding the handcrafted similarity matrix, TransVCL incorporates long-range temporal information between feature sequence pair using self- and cross- attention layers. With the joint design and optimization of three components, the similarity matrix can be learned to present more discriminative copied patterns, leading to significant improvements over previous methods on segment-level labeled datasets (VCSL and VCDB). Besides the state-of-the-art performance in fully supervised setting, the attention architecture facilitates TransVCL to further exploit unlabeled or simply video-level labeled data. Additional experiments of supplementing video-level labeled datasets including SVD and FIVR reveal the high flexibility of TransVCL from full supervision to semi-supervision (with or without video-level annotation).

 - **Abstract**
 In a future with autonomous robots, visual and spatial perception is of utmost importance for robotic systems. Particularly for aerial robotics, there are many applications where utilizing visual perception is necessary for any real-world scenarios. Robotic aerial grasping using drones promises fast pick-and-place solutions with a large increase in mobility over other robotic solutions. Utilizing Mask R-CNN scene segmentation (detectron2), we propose a vision-based system for autonomous rapid aerial grasping which does not rely on markers for object localization and does not require the size of the object to be previously known. With spatial information from a depth camera, we generate a point cloud of the detected objects and perform geometry-based grasp planning to determine grasping points on the objects. In real-world experiments, we show that our system can localize objects with a mean error of 3 cm compared to a motion capture ground truth for distances from the object ranging from 0.5 m to 2.5 m. Similar grasping efficacy is maintained compared to a system using motion capture for object localization in experiments. With our results, we show the first use of geometry-based grasping techniques with a flying platform and aim to increase the autonomy of existing aerial manipulation platforms, bringing them further towards real-world applications in warehouses and similar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual explanation of "black-box" models has enabled researchers and experts in artificial intelligence (AI) to exploit the localization abilities of such methods to a much greater extent. Despite most of the developed visual explanation methods applied to single object classification problems, they are not well-explored in the detection task, where the challenges may go beyond simple coarse area-based discrimination. This is of particular importance when a detector should face several objects with different scales from various viewpoints or if the objects of interest are absent. In this paper, we propose CrownCAM to generate reliable visual explanations for the challenging and dynamic problem of tree crown detection in aerial images. It efficiently provides fine-grain localization of tree crowns and non-contextual background suppression for scenarios with highly dense forest trees in the presence of potential distractors or scenes without tree crowns. Additionally, two Intersection over Union (IoU)-based metrics are introduced that can effectively quantify both the accuracy and inaccuracy of generated visual explanations with respect to regions with or without tree crowns in the image. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed Crown-CAM outperforms the Score-CAM, Augmented ScoreCAM, and Eigen-CAM methods by an average IoU margin of 8.7, 5.3, and 21.7 (and 3.3, 9.8, and 16.5) respectively in improving the accuracy (and decreasing inaccuracy) of visual explanations on the challenging NEON tree crown dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent diffusion-based generative models combined with vision-language models are capable of creating realistic images from natural language prompts. While these models are trained on large internet-scale datasets, such pre-trained models are not directly introduced to any semantic localization or grounding. Most current approaches for localization or grounding rely on human-annotated localization information in the form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks. The exceptions are a few unsupervised methods that utilize architectures or loss functions geared towards localization, but they need to be trained separately. In this work, we explore how off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained with no exposure to such localization information, are capable of grounding various semantic phrases with no segmentation-specific re-training. An inference time optimization process is introduced, that is capable of generating segmentation masks conditioned on natural language. We evaluate our proposal Peekaboo for unsupervised semantic segmentation on the Pascal VOC dataset. In addition, we evaluate for referring segmentation on the RefCOCO dataset. In summary, we present a first zero-shot, open-vocabulary, unsupervised (no localization information), semantic grounding technique leveraging diffusion-based generative models with no re-training. Our code will be released publicly.

 - **Abstract**
 Emotions are experienced and expressed through various response systems. Coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression is considered important to clients' well being. To date, emotional coherence (EC) has been studied at a single time point using lab-based tasks with relatively small datasets. No study has examined EC between the subjective experience of emotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is associated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing (NLP) approaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue, which can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale. However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it relates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model to study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy research. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew psychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance level in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional coherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based emotion predictions. We also examine the association between emotional coherence and clients' well being. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between clients' self-reported emotions and positive and negative emotions expressed verbally during psychotherapy sessions. Coherence in positive emotions was also highly correlated with clients well-being. These results illustrate how NLP can be applied to identify important emotional processes in psychotherapy to improve diagnosis and treatment for clients suffering from mental-health problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Place recognition based on point cloud (LiDAR) scans is an important module for achieving robust autonomy in robots or self-driving vehicles. Training deep networks to match such scans presents a difficult trade-off: a higher spatial resolution of the network's intermediate representations is needed to perform fine-grained matching of subtle geometric features, but growing it too large makes the memory requirements infeasible. In this work, we propose a Point-Voxel Transformer network (PVT3D) that achieves robust fine-grained matching with low memory requirements. It leverages a sparse voxel branch to extract and aggregate information at a lower resolution and a point-wise branch to obtain fine-grained local information. A novel hierarchical cross-attention transformer (HCAT) uses queries from one branch to try to match structures in the other branch, ensuring that both extract self-contained descriptors of the point cloud (rather than one branch dominating), but using both to inform the output global descriptor of the point cloud. Extensive experiments show that the proposed PVT3D method surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large amount on several datasets (Oxford RobotCar, TUM, USyd). For instance, we achieve AR@1 of 85.6% on the TUM dataset, which surpasses the strongest prior model by ~15%.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant knowledge fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., multimodal documents on the web). Specifically, we implement a retriever using the pretrained CLIP model and a generator using the CM3 Transformer architecture, and train this model using the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate mixtures of text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities such as knowledge-intensive image generation and multimodal in-context learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research in robust optimization has shown an overfitting-like phenomenon in which models trained against adversarial attacks exhibit higher robustness on the training set compared to the test set. Although previous work provided theoretical explanations for this phenomenon using a robust PAC-Bayesian bound over the adversarial test error, related algorithmic derivations are at best only loosely connected to this bound, which implies that there is still a gap between their empirical success and our understanding of adversarial robustness theory. To close this gap, in this paper we consider a different form of the robust PAC-Bayesian bound and directly minimize it with respect to the model posterior. The derivation of the optimal solution connects PAC-Bayesian learning to the geometry of the robust loss surface through a Trace of Hessian (TrH) regularizer that measures the surface flatness. In practice, we restrict the TrH regularizer to the top layer only, which results in an analytical solution to the bound whose computational cost does not depend on the network depth. Finally, we evaluate our TrH regularization approach over CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet using Vision Transformers (ViT) and compare against baseline adversarial robustness algorithms. Experimental results show that TrH regularization leads to improved ViT robustness that either matches or surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches while at the same time requires less memory and computational cost.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present an integral pre-training framework based on masked image modeling (MIM). We advocate for pre-training the backbone and neck jointly so that the transfer gap between MIM and downstream recognition tasks is minimal. We make two technical contributions. First, we unify the reconstruction and recognition necks by inserting a feature pyramid into the pre-training stage. Second, we complement mask image modeling (MIM) with masked feature modeling (MFM) that offers multi-stage supervision to the feature pyramid. The pre-trained models, termed integrally pre-trained transformer pyramid networks (iTPNs), serve as powerful foundation models for visual recognition. In particular, the base/large-level iTPN achieves an 86.2%/87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, a 53.2%/55.6% box AP on COCO object detection with 1x training schedule using Mask-RCNN, and a 54.7%/57.7% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation using UPerHead -- all these results set new records. Our work inspires the community to work on unifying upstream pre-training and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Code and the pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/sunsmarterjie/iTPN.

 - **Abstract**
 In many vision and robotics applications, it is common that the captured objects are represented by very few points. Most of the existing completion methods are designed for partial point clouds with many points, and they perform poorly or even fail completely in the case of few points. However, due to the lack of detail information, completing objects from few points faces a huge challenge. Inspired by the successful applications of GAN and Transformers in the image-based vision task, we introduce GAN and Transformer techniques to address the above problem. Firstly, the end-to-end encoder-decoder network with Transformers and the Wasserstein GAN with Transformer are pre-trained, and then the overall network is fine-tuned. Experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset show that our method can not only improve the completion performance for many input points, but also keep stable for few input points.

 - **Abstract**
 Static appearance of video may impede the ability of a deep neural network to learn motion-relevant features in video action recognition. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, Dynamic Appearance (DA), summarizing the appearance information relating to movement in a video while filtering out the static information considered unrelated to motion. We consider distilling the dynamic appearance from raw video data as a means of efficient video understanding. To this end, we propose the Pixel-Wise Temporal Projection (PWTP), which projects the static appearance of a video into a subspace within its original vector space, while the dynamic appearance is encoded in the projection residual describing a special motion pattern. Moreover, we integrate the PWTP module with a CNN or Transformer into an end-to-end training framework, which is optimized by utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms. We provide extensive experimental results on four action recognition benchmarks: Kinetics400, Something-Something V1, UCF101 and HMDB51.

 - **Abstract**
 Legal documents are typically long and written in legalese, which makes it particularly difficult for laypeople to understand their rights and duties. While natural language understanding technologies can be valuable in supporting such understanding in the legal domain, the limited availability of datasets annotated for deontic modalities in the legal domain, due to the cost of hiring experts and privacy issues, is a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce, LEXDEMOD, a corpus of English contracts annotated with deontic modality expressed with respect to a contracting party or agent along with the modal triggers. We benchmark this dataset on two tasks: (i) agent-specific multi-label deontic modality classification, and (ii) agent-specific deontic modality and trigger span detection using Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models. Transfer learning experiments show that the linguistic diversity of modal expressions in LEXDEMOD generalizes reasonably from lease to employment and rental agreements. A small case study indicates that a model trained on LEXDEMOD can detect red flags with high recall. We believe our work offers a new research direction for deontic modality detection in the legal domain.

 - **Abstract**
 Auxiliary diagnosis of cardiac electrophysiological status can be obtained through the analysis of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). This work proposes a dual-scale lead-separated transformer with lead-orthogonal attention and meta-information (DLTM-ECG) as a novel approach to address this challenge. ECG segments of each lead are interpreted as independent patches, and together with the reduced dimension signal, they form a dual-scale representation. As a method to reduce interference from segments with low correlation, two group attention mechanisms perform both lead-internal and cross-lead attention. Our method allows for the addition of previously discarded meta-information, further improving the utilization of clinical information. Experimental results show that our DLTM-ECG yields significantly better classification scores than other transformer-based models,matching or performing better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods on two benchmark datasets. Our work has the potential for similar multichannel bioelectrical signal processing and physiological multimodal tasks.

 In recent years, there has been a wide interest in designing deep neural network-based models that automate downstream software engineering tasks, such as program document generation, code search, and program repair. Although the main objective of these studies is to improve the effectiveness of the downstream task, many studies only attempt to employ the next best neural network model, without a proper in-depth analysis of why a particular solution works or does not, on particular tasks or scenarios. In this paper, using an eXplainable AI (XAI) method (attention mechanism), we study state-of-the-art Transformer-based models (CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT) on a set of software engineering downstream tasks: code document generation (CDG), code refinement (CR), and code translation (CT). We first evaluate the validity of the attention mechanism on each particular task. Then, through quantitative and qualitative studies, we identify what CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT learn (put the highest attention on, in terms of source code token types), on these tasks. Finally, we show some of the common patterns when the model does not work as expected (perform poorly while the problem in hand is easy) and suggest recommendations that may alleviate the observed challenges.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the vision transformer (ViT) has made breakthroughs in image recognition. Its self-attention mechanism (MSA) can extract discriminative labeling information of different pixel blocks to improve image classification accuracy. However, the classification marks in their deep layers tend to ignore local features between layers. In addition, the embedding layer will be fixed-size pixel blocks. Input network Inevitably introduces additional image noise. To this end, this paper studies a data augmentation vision transformer (DAVT) based on data augmentation and proposes a data augmentation method for attention cropping, which uses attention weights as the guide to crop images and improve the ability of the network to learn critical features. Secondly, this paper also proposes a hierarchical attention selection (HAS) method, which improves the ability of discriminative markers between levels of learning by filtering and fusing labels between levels. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this method on the two general datasets, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford Dogs, is better than the existing mainstream methods, and its accuracy is 1.4\% and 1.6\% higher than the original ViT, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural networks for video action recognition easily learn to utilize shortcut static features, such as background and objects instead of motion features. This results in poor generalization to atypical videos such as soccer playing on concrete surfaces (instead of soccer fields). However, due to the rarity of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, quantitative evaluation of static bias remains a difficult task. In this paper, we synthesize new sets of benchmarks to evaluate static bias of action representations, including SCUB for static cues in the background, and SCUF for static cues in the foreground. Further, we propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation technique, StillMix, that automatically identifies bias-inducing video frames; unlike similar augmentation techniques, StillMix does not need to enumerate or precisely segment biased content. With extensive experiments, we quantitatively compare and analyze existing action recognition models on the created benchmarks to reveal their characteristics. We validate the effectiveness of StillMix and show that it improves TSM (Lin, Gan, and Han 2021) and Video Swin Transformer (Liu et al. 2021) by more than 10% of accuracy on SCUB for OOD action recognition.

 - **Abstract**
 Applications of force control and motion planning often rely on an inverse dynamics model to represent the high-dimensional dynamic behavior of robots during motion. The widespread occurrence of low-velocity, small-scale, locally isotropic motion (LIMO) typically complicates the identification of appropriate models due to the exaggeration of dynamic effects and sensory perturbation caused by complex friction and phenomena of hysteresis, e.g., pertaining to joint elasticity. We propose a hybrid model learning base architectures combining a rigid body dynamics model identified by parametric regression and time-series neural network architectures based on multilayer-perceptron, LSTM, and Transformer topologies. Further, we introduce novel joint-wise rotational history encoding, reinforcing temporal information to effectively model dynamic hysteresis. The models are evaluated on a KUKA iiwa 14 during algorithmically generated locally isotropic movements. Together with the rotational encoding, the proposed architectures outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a magnitude of 10$^3$ yielding an RMSE of 0.14 Nm. Leveraging the hybrid structure and time-series encoding capabilities, our approach allows for accurate torque estimation, indicating its applicability in critically force-sensitive applications during motion sequences exceeding the capacity of conventional inverse dynamics models while retaining trainability in face of scarce data and explainability due to the employed physics model prior.

 - **Abstract**
 Sarcasm detection is an essential task that can help identify the actual sentiment in user-generated data, such as discussion forums or tweets. Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of linguistic expression because its surface meaning usually contradicts its inner, deeper meaning. Such incongruity is the essential component of sarcasm, however, it makes sarcasm detection quite a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a model which incorporates emotion and sentiment features to capture the incongruity intrinsic to sarcasm. Moreover, we use CNN and pre-trained Transformer to capture context features. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on four datasets from social networking platforms and online media.

 - **Abstract**
 Video copy localization aims to precisely localize all the copied segments within a pair of untrimmed videos in video retrieval applications. Previous methods typically start from frame-to-frame similarity matrix generated by cosine similarity between frame-level features of the input video pair, and then detect and refine the boundaries of copied segments on similarity matrix under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose TransVCL: an attention-enhanced video copy localization network, which is optimized directly from initial frame-level features and trained end-to-end with three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for similarity matrix generation, and a temporal alignment module for copied segments localization. In contrast to previous methods demanding the handcrafted similarity matrix, TransVCL incorporates long-range temporal information between feature sequence pair using self- and cross- attention layers. With the joint design and optimization of three components, the similarity matrix can be learned to present more discriminative copied patterns, leading to significant improvements over previous methods on segment-level labeled datasets (VCSL and VCDB). Besides the state-of-the-art performance in fully supervised setting, the attention architecture facilitates TransVCL to further exploit unlabeled or simply video-level labeled data. Additional experiments of supplementing video-level labeled datasets including SVD and FIVR reveal the high flexibility of TransVCL from full supervision to semi-supervision (with or without video-level annotation). Code is publicly available at https://github.com/transvcl/TransVCL.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers, which were originally developed for natural language processing, have recently generated significant interest in the computer vision and audio communities due to their flexibility in learning long-range relationships. Constrained by data hungry nature of transformers and limited labelled data most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from ImageNet pretrained models, despite the huge gap between the natural images domain and audio domain. This has motivated the research in self-supervised pretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large amounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representation of the audio spectrograms. In this paper, we propose ASiT, a novel self-supervised transformer for general audio representations that captures local and global contextual information employing group masked model learning and self-distillation. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies, including evaluations of different pretraining strategies. The proposed ASiT framework significantly boosts the performance on all tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art performance on five audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming recent methods, including the approaches that use additional datasets for pretraining. The code and pretrained weights will be made publicly available for the scientific community.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection and recognition of a licence plate is important when automating weighbridge services. While many large databases are available for Latin and Chinese alphanumeric license plates, data for Indian License Plates is inadequate. In particular, databases of Indian commercial truck license plates are inadequate, despite the fact that commercial vehicle license plate recognition plays a profound role in terms of logistics management and weighbridge automation. Moreover, models to recognise license plates are not effectively able to generalise to such data due to its challenging nature, and due to the abundant frequency of handwritten license plates, leading to the usage of diverse font styles. Thus, a database and effective models to recognise and detect such license plates are crucial. This paper provides a database on commercial truck license plates, and using state-of-the-art models in real-time object Detection: You Only Look Once Version 7, and SceneText Recognition: Permuted Autoregressive Sequence Models, our method outperforms the other cited references where the maximum accuracy obtained was less than 90%, while we have achieved 95.82% accuracy in our algorithm implementation on the presented challenging license plate dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised monocular depth estimation that does not require ground-truth for training has attracted attention in recent years. It is of high interest to design lightweight but effective models, so that they can be deployed on edge devices. Many existing architectures benefit from using heavier backbones at the expense of model sizes. In this paper we achieve comparable results with a lightweight architecture. Specifically, we investigate the efficient combination of CNNs and Transformers, and design a hybrid architecture Lite-Mono. A Consecutive Dilated Convolutions (CDC) module and a Local-Global Features Interaction (LGFI) module are proposed. The former is used to extract rich multi-scale local features, and the latter takes advantage of the self-attention mechanism to encode long-range global information into the features. Experiments demonstrate that our full model outperforms Monodepth2 by a large margin in accuracy, with about 80% fewer trainable parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Computer vision models suffer from a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting when learning novel concepts from continuously shifting training data. Typical solutions for this continual learning problem require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data, which increases memory costs and may violate data privacy. Recently, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision transformer models has enabled prompting approaches as an alternative to data-rehearsal. These approaches rely on a key-query mechanism to generate prompts and have been found to be highly resistant to catastrophic forgetting in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting. However, the key mechanism of these methods is not trained end-to-end with the task sequence. Our experiments show that this leads to a reduction in their plasticity, hence sacrificing new task accuracy, and inability to benefit from expanded parameter capacity. We instead propose to learn a set of prompt components which are assembled with input-conditioned weights to produce input-conditioned prompts, resulting in a novel attention-based end-to-end key-query scheme. Our experiments show that we outperform the current SOTA method DualPrompt on established benchmarks by as much as 5.4% in average accuracy. We also outperform the state of art by as much as 6.6% accuracy on a continual learning benchmark which contains both class-incremental and domain-incremental task shifts, corresponding to many practical settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-supervised action recognition is a challenging but critical task due to the high cost of video annotations. Existing approaches mainly use convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end, we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (ie, EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition. We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube TokenMix, tailored for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400. Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks.
### Self-Supervised Learning based on Heat Equation

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a new perspective of self-supervised learning based on extending heat equation into high dimensional feature space. In particular, we remove time dependence by steady-state condition, and extend the remaining 2D Laplacian from x--y isotropic to linear correlated. Furthermore, we simplify it by splitting x and y axes as two first-order linear differential equations. Such simplification explicitly models the spatial invariance along horizontal and vertical directions separately, supporting prediction across image blocks. This introduces a very simple masked image modeling (MIM) method, named QB-Heat. QB-Heat leaves a single block with size of quarter image unmasked and extrapolates other three masked quarters linearly. It brings MIM to CNNs without bells and whistles, and even works well for pre-training light-weight networks that are suitable for both image classification and object detection without fine-tuning. Compared with MoCo-v2 on pre-training a Mobile-Former with 5.8M parameters and 285M FLOPs, QB-Heat is on par in linear probing on ImageNet, but clearly outperforms in non-linear probing that adds a transformer block before linear classifier (65.6% vs. 52.9%). When transferring to object detection with frozen backbone, QB-Heat outperforms MoCo-v2 and supervised pre-training on ImageNet by 7.9 and 4.5 AP respectively. This work provides an insightful hypothesis on the invariance within visual representation over different shapes and textures: the linear relationship between horizontal and vertical derivatives. The code will be publicly released.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a practical verification method for safety analysis of the autonomous driving system (ADS). The main idea is to build a surrogate model that quantitatively depicts the behaviour of an ADS in the specified traffic scenario. The safety properties proved in the resulting surrogate model apply to the original ADS with a probabilistic guarantee. Furthermore, we explore the safe and the unsafe parameter space of the traffic scenario for driving hazards. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach by evaluating safety properties on the state-of-the-art ADS in literature, with a variety of simulated traffic scenarios.
### Pruned Lightweight Encoders for Computer Vision

 - **Abstract**
 Latency-critical computer vision systems, such as autonomous driving or drone control, require fast image or video compression when offloading neural network inference to a remote computer. To ensure low latency on a near-sensor edge device, we propose the use of lightweight encoders with constant bitrate and pruned encoding configurations, namely, ASTC and JPEG XS. Pruning introduces significant distortion which we show can be recovered by retraining the neural network with compressed data after decompression. Such an approach does not modify the network architecture or require coding format modifications. By retraining with compressed datasets, we reduced the classification accuracy and segmentation mean intersection over union (mIoU) degradation due to ASTC compression to 4.9-5.0 percentage points (pp) and 4.4-4.0 pp, respectively. With the same method, the mIoU lost due to JPEG XS compression at the main profile was restored to 2.7-2.3 pp. In terms of encoding speed, our ASTC encoder implementation is 2.3x faster than JPEG. Even though the JPEG XS reference encoder requires optimizations to reach low latency, we showed that disabling significance flag coding saves 22-23% of encoding time at the cost of 0.4-0.3 mIoU after retraining.
