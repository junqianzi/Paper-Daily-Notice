 - **Abstract**
 Vision-based sensors have shown significant performance, accuracy, and efficiency gain in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems in recent years. In this regard, Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods refer to the SLAM approaches that employ cameras for pose estimation and map generation. We can see many research works that demonstrated VSLAMs can outperform traditional methods, which rely only on a particular sensor, such as a Lidar, even with lower costs. VSLAM approaches utilize different camera types (e.g., monocular, stereo, and RGB-D), have been tested on various datasets (e.g., KITTI, TUM RGB-D, and EuRoC) and in dissimilar environments (e.g., indoors and outdoors), and employ multiple algorithms and methodologies to have a better understanding of the environment. The mentioned variations have made this topic popular for researchers and resulted in a wide range of VSLAMs methodologies. In this regard, the primary intent of this survey is to present the recent advances in VSLAM systems, along with discussing the existing challenges and trends. We have given an in-depth literature survey of forty-five impactful papers published in the domain of VSLAMs. We have classified these manuscripts by different characteristics, including the novelty domain, objectives, employed algorithms, and semantic level. We also discuss the current trends and future directions that may help researchers investigate them.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10424
 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a novel LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), named SR-LIO, based on an improved bundle adjustment (BA) framework. The core of our SR-LIO is a novel sweep reconstruction method, which segments and reconstructs raw input sweeps from spinning LiDAR to obtain reconstructed sweeps with higher frequency. Such method can effectively reduce the time interval for each IMU pre-integration, reducing the IMU pre-integration error and enabling the usage of BA based LIO optimization. In order to make all the states during the period of a reconstructed sweep can be equally optimized, we further propose multi-segment joint LIO optimization, which allows the state of each sweep segment to be constrained from both LiDAR and IMU. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our SR-LIO outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods on accuracy, and reducing the IMU pre-integration error via the proposed sweep reconstruction is very importance for the success of a BA based LIO framework. The source code of SR-LIO is publicly available for the development of the community.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the problem of domain adaptation in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Towards this, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy called Gradual Batch Alternation that can adapt from a large labeled source domain to an insufficiently labeled target domain. The idea is to initiate the training with the batch of samples from the source and target domain data in an alternate fashion, but then gradually reduce the amount of the source domain data over time as the training progresses. This way the model slowly shifts towards the target domain and eventually better adapt to it. The domain adaptation experiments for 3D object detection on four benchmark autonomous driving datasets, namely ONCE, PandaSet, Waymo, and nuScenes, demonstrate significant performance gains over prior arts and strong baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Collaborative robotic industrial cells are workspaces where robots collaborate with human operators. In this context, safety is paramount, and for that a complete perception of the space where the collaborative robot is inserted is necessary. To ensure this, collaborative cells are equipped with a large set of sensors of multiple modalities, covering the entire work volume. However, the fusion of information from all these sensors requires an accurate extrinsic calibration. The calibration of such complex systems is challenging, due to the number of sensors and modalities, and also due to the small overlapping fields of view between the sensors, which are positioned to capture different viewpoints of the cell. This paper proposes a sensor to pattern methodology that can calibrate a complex system such as a collaborative cell in a single optimization procedure. Our methodology can tackle RGB and Depth cameras, as well as LiDARs. Results show that our methodology is able to accurately calibrate a collaborative cell containing three RGB cameras, a depth camera and three 3D LiDARs.

 - **Abstract**
 With the development of neural networks and the increasing popularity of automatic driving, the calibration of the LiDAR and the camera has attracted more and more attention. This calibration task is multi-modal, where the rich color and texture information captured by the camera and the accurate three-dimensional spatial information from the LiDAR is incredibly significant for downstream tasks. Current research interests mainly focus on obtaining accurate calibration results through information fusion. However, they seldom analyze whether the calibrated results are correct or not, which could be of significant importance in real-world applications. For example, in large-scale production, the LiDARs and the cameras of each smart car have to get well-calibrated as the car leaves the production line, while in the rest of the car life period, the poses of the LiDARs and cameras should also get continually supervised to ensure the security. To this end, this paper proposes a self-checking algorithm to judge whether the extrinsic parameters are well-calibrated by introducing a binary classification network based on the fused information from the camera and the LiDAR. Moreover, since there is no such dataset for the task in this work, we further generate a new dataset branch from the KITTI dataset tailored for the task. Our experiments on the proposed dataset branch demonstrate the performance of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the significance of continually checking the calibrated extrinsic parameters for autonomous driving. The code is open-sourced on the Github website at https://github.com/OpenCalib/LiDAR2camera_self-check.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10108
 - **Abstract**
 We present a parallelized optimization method based on fast Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for estimating 6-DoF target poses. Given a single observed RGB image of the target, we can predict the translation and rotation of the camera by minimizing the residual between pixels rendered from a fast NeRF model and pixels in the observed image. We integrate a momentum-based camera extrinsic optimization procedure into Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, a recent exceptionally fast NeRF implementation. By introducing parallel Monte Carlo sampling into the pose estimation task, our method overcomes local minima and improves efficiency in a more extensive search space. We also show the importance of adopting a more robust pixel-based loss function to reduce error. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve improved generalization and robustness on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Generating 3D point cloud (PC) data from noisy sonar measurements is a problem that has potential applications for bathymetry mapping, artificial object inspection, mapping of aquatic plants and fauna as well as underwater navigation and localization of vehicles such as submarines. Side-scan sonar sensors are available in inexpensive cost ranges, especially in fish-finders, where the transducers are usually mounted to the bottom of a boat and can approach shallower depths than the ones attached to an Uncrewed Underwater Vehicle (UUV) can. However, extracting 3D information from side-scan sonar imagery is a difficult task because of its low signal-to-noise ratio and missing angle and depth information in the imagery. Since most algorithms that generate a 3D point cloud from side-scan sonar imagery use Shape from Shading (SFS) techniques, extracting 3D information is especially difficult when the seafloor is smooth, is slowly changing in depth, or does not have identifiable objects that make acoustic shadows. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm that generates a sparse 3D point cloud from side-scan sonar images. This computation is done in a computationally efficient manner by leveraging the geometry of the first sonar return combined with known positions provided by GPS and down-scan sonar depth measurement at each data point. Additionally, this paper implements another algorithm that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning to perform object detection on side-scan sonar images collected in real life and generated with a simulation. The algorithm was tested on both real and synthetic images to show reasonably accurate anomaly detection and classification.
### Towards Explaining Distribution Shifts

 - **Abstract**
 A distribution shift can have fundamental consequences such as signaling a change in the operating environment or significantly reducing the accuracy of downstream models. Thus, understanding distribution shifts is critical for examining and hopefully mitigating the effect of such a shift. Most prior work has focused on merely detecting if a shift has occurred and assumes any detected shift can be understood and handled appropriately by a human operator. We hope to aid in these manual mitigation tasks by explaining the distribution shift using interpretable transportation maps from the original distribution to the shifted one. We derive our interpretable mappings from a relaxation of the optimal transport problem, where the candidate mappings are restricted to a set of interpretable mappings. We then use quintessential examples of distribution shift in simulated and real-world cases to showcase how our explanatory mappings provide a better balance between detail and interpretability than the de facto standard mean shift explanation by both visual inspection and our PercentExplained metric.

 - **Abstract**
 A key aspect of the precision of a mobile robots localization is the quality and aptness of the map it is using. A variety of mapping approaches are available that can be employed to create such maps with varying degrees of effort, hardware requirements and quality of the resulting maps. To create a better understanding of the applicability of these different approaches to specific applications, this paper evaluates and compares three different mapping approaches based on simultaneous localization and mapping, terrestrial laser scanning as well as publicly accessible building contours.

 - **Abstract**
 With their widespread availability, FPGA-based accelerators cards have become an alternative to GPUs and CPUs to accelerate computing in applications with certain requirements (like energy efficiency) or properties (like fixed-point computations). In this paper we show results and experiences from mapping an industrial application used for drug discovery on several types of accelerators. We especially highlight the effort versus benefit of FPGAs compared to CPUs and GPUs in terms of performance and energy efficiency. For this application, even with extensive use of FPGA-specific features, and performing different optimizations, results on GPUs are still better, both in terms of energy and performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Ensuring fairness of prediction-based decision making is based on statistical group fairness criteria. Which one of these criteria is the morally most appropriate one depends on the context, and its choice requires an ethical analysis. In this paper, we present a step-by-step procedure integrating three elements: (a) a framework for the moral assessment of what fairness means in a given context, based on the recently proposed general principle of "Fair equality of chances" (FEC) (b) a mapping of the assessment's results to established statistical group fairness criteria, and (c) a method for integrating the thus-defined fairness into optimal decision making. As a second contribution, we show new applications of the FEC principle and show that, with this extension, the FEC framework covers all types of group fairness criteria: independence, separation, and sufficiency. Third, we introduce an extended version of the FEC principle, which additionally allows accounting for morally irrelevant elements of the fairness assessment and links to well-known relaxations of the fairness criteria. This paper presents a framework to develop fair decision systems in a conceptually sound way, combining the moral and the computational elements of fair prediction-based decision-making in an integrated approach. Data and code to reproduce our results are available at https://github.com/joebaumann/fair-prediction-based-decision-making.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of multi-object tracking is a fundamental computer vision research focus, widely used in public safety, transport, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other regions involving artificial intelligence. Because of the complexity of natural scenes, object occlusion and semi-occlusion usually occur in fundamental tracking tasks. These can easily lead to ID switching, object loss, detect errors, and misaligned limitation boxes. These conditions have a significant impact on the precision of multi-object tracking. In this paper, we design a new multi-object tracker for the above issues that contains an object \textbf{Relative Location Mapping} (RLM) model and \textbf{Target Region Density} (TRD) model. The new tracker is more sensitive to the differences in position relationships between objects. It can introduce low-score detection frames into different regions in real-time according to the density of object regions in the video. This improves the accuracy of object tracking without consuming extensive arithmetic resources. Our study shows that the proposed model has considerably enhanced the HOTA and DF1 measurements on the MOT17 and MOT20 data sets when applied to the advanced MOT method.

### Language Models Understand Us, Poorly

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10684
 - **Abstract**
 Some claim language models understand us. Others won't hear it. To clarify, I investigate three views of human language understanding: as-mapping, as-reliability and as-representation. I argue that while behavioral reliability is necessary for understanding, internal representations are sufficient; they climb the right hill. I review state-of-the-art language and multi-modal models: they are pragmatically challenged by under-specification of form. I question the Scaling Paradigm: limits on resources may prohibit scaled-up models from approaching understanding. Last, I describe how as-representation advances a science of understanding. We need work which probes model internals, adds more of human language, and measures what models can learn.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce OpenEarthMap, a benchmark dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap consists of 2.2 million segments of 5000 aerial and satellite images covering 97 regions from 44 countries across 6 continents, with manually annotated 8-class land cover labels at a 0.25--0.5m ground sampling distance. Semantic segmentation models trained on the OpenEarthMap generalize worldwide and can be used as off-the-shelf models in a variety of applications. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised domain adaptation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. We also investigate lightweight models using automated neural architecture search for limited computational resources and fast mapping. The dataset is available at https://open-earth-map.org.

 - **Abstract**
 Localization and mapping is the foundational technology for augmented reality (AR) that enables sharing and persistence of digital content in the real world. While significant progress has been made, researchers are still mostly driven by unrealistic benchmarks not representative of real-world AR scenarios. These benchmarks are often based on small-scale datasets with low scene diversity, captured from stationary cameras, and lack other sensor inputs like inertial, radio, or depth data. Furthermore, their ground-truth (GT) accuracy is mostly insufficient to satisfy AR requirements. To close this gap, we introduce LaMAR, a new benchmark with a comprehensive capture and GT pipeline that co-registers realistic trajectories and sensor streams captured by heterogeneous AR devices in large, unconstrained scenes. To establish an accurate GT, our pipeline robustly aligns the trajectories against laser scans in a fully automated manner. As a result, we publish a benchmark dataset of diverse and large-scale scenes recorded with head-mounted and hand-held AR devices. We extend several state-of-the-art methods to take advantage of the AR-specific setup and evaluate them on our benchmark. The results offer new insights on current research and reveal promising avenues for future work in the field of localization and mapping for AR.

 - **Abstract**
 Named entity recognition is a traditional task in natural language processing. In particular, nested entity recognition receives extensive attention for the widespread existence of the nesting scenario. The latest research migrates the well-established paradigm of set prediction in object detection to cope with entity nesting. However, the manual creation of query vectors, which fail to adapt to the rich semantic information in the context, limits these approaches. An end-to-end entity detection approach with proposer and regressor is presented in this paper to tackle the issues. First, the proposer utilizes the feature pyramid network to generate high-quality entity proposals. Then, the regressor refines the proposals for generating the final prediction. The model adopts encoder-only architecture and thus obtains the advantages of the richness of query semantics, high precision of entity localization, and easiness for model training. Moreover, we introduce the novel spatially modulated attention and progressive refinement for further improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves advanced performance in flat and nested NER, achieving a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 80.74 on the GENIA dataset and 72.38 on the WeiboNER dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn considerable attention for its ability to enhance the performance of not only the wireless communication but also the indoor localization with low-cost. This paper investigates the performance limits of the RIS-based near-field localization in the asynchronous scenario, and analyzes the impact of each part of the cascaded channel on the localization performance. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB) are derived. Besides, we also derive the equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for the position-related intermediate parameters. Enabled by the derived EFI, we show that the information for both the distance and the direction of the user can be obtained when the near-field spherical wavefront is considered for the RIS-User equipment (UE) part of the channel, while only the direction of the UE can be inferred in the far-field scenario. For the base station (BS)-RIS part of the channel, we reveal that this part of the channel determines the type of the gain provided by the BS antenna array. We also show that the well-known focusing control scheme for RIS, which maximizes the received SNR, is not always a good choice and may degrade the localization performance in the asynchronous scenario. The simulation results validate the analytic work. The impact of the focusing control scheme on the PEB performances under synchronous and asynchronous conditions is also investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes an efficient iris localization method without using iris segmentation and circle fitting. Conventional iris localization methods first extract iris regions by using semantic segmentation methods such as U-Net. Afterward, the inner and outer iris circles are localized using the traditional circle fitting algorithm. However, this approach requires high-resolution encoder-decoder networks for iris segmentation, so it causes computational costs to be high. In addition, traditional circle fitting tends to be sensitive to noise in input images and fitting parameters, causing the iris recognition performance to be poor. To solve these problems, we propose an iris localization network (ILN), that can directly localize pupil and iris circles with eyelid points from a low-resolution iris image. We also introduce a pupil refinement network (PRN) to improve the accuracy of pupil localization. Experimental results show that the combination of ILN and PRN works in 34.5 ms for one iris image on a CPU, and its localization performance outperforms conventional iris segmentation methods. In addition, generalized evaluation results show that the proposed method has higher robustness for datasets in different domain than other segmentation methods. Furthermore, we also confirm that the proposed ILN and PRN improve the iris recognition accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision-based sensors have shown significant performance, accuracy, and efficiency gain in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems in recent years. In this regard, Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods refer to the SLAM approaches that employ cameras for pose estimation and map generation. We can see many research works that demonstrated VSLAMs can outperform traditional methods, which rely only on a particular sensor, such as a Lidar, even with lower costs. VSLAM approaches utilize different camera types (e.g., monocular, stereo, and RGB-D), have been tested on various datasets (e.g., KITTI, TUM RGB-D, and EuRoC) and in dissimilar environments (e.g., indoors and outdoors), and employ multiple algorithms and methodologies to have a better understanding of the environment. The mentioned variations have made this topic popular for researchers and resulted in a wide range of VSLAMs methodologies. In this regard, the primary intent of this survey is to present the recent advances in VSLAM systems, along with discussing the existing challenges and trends. We have given an in-depth literature survey of forty-five impactful papers published in the domain of VSLAMs. We have classified these manuscripts by different characteristics, including the novelty domain, objectives, employed algorithms, and semantic level. We also discuss the current trends and future directions that may help researchers investigate them.

 - **Abstract**
 Localization and mapping is the foundational technology for augmented reality (AR) that enables sharing and persistence of digital content in the real world. While significant progress has been made, researchers are still mostly driven by unrealistic benchmarks not representative of real-world AR scenarios. These benchmarks are often based on small-scale datasets with low scene diversity, captured from stationary cameras, and lack other sensor inputs like inertial, radio, or depth data. Furthermore, their ground-truth (GT) accuracy is mostly insufficient to satisfy AR requirements. To close this gap, we introduce LaMAR, a new benchmark with a comprehensive capture and GT pipeline that co-registers realistic trajectories and sensor streams captured by heterogeneous AR devices in large, unconstrained scenes. To establish an accurate GT, our pipeline robustly aligns the trajectories against laser scans in a fully automated manner. As a result, we publish a benchmark dataset of diverse and large-scale scenes recorded with head-mounted and hand-held AR devices. We extend several state-of-the-art methods to take advantage of the AR-specific setup and evaluate them on our benchmark. The results offer new insights on current research and reveal promising avenues for future work in the field of localization and mapping for AR.

 - **Abstract**
 We tackle the problem of novel class discovery, detection, and localization (NCDL). In this setting, we assume a source dataset with labels for objects of commonly observed classes. Instances of other classes need to be discovered, classified, and localized automatically based on visual similarity, without human supervision. To this end, we propose a two-stage object detection network Region-based NCDL (RNCDL), that uses a region proposal network to localize object candidates and is trained to classify each candidate, either as one of the known classes, seen in the source dataset, or one of the extended set of novel classes, with a long-tail distribution constraint on the class assignments, reflecting the natural frequency of classes in the real world. By training our detection network with this objective in an end-to-end manner, it learns to classify all region proposals for a large variety of classes, including those that are not part of the labeled object class vocabulary. Our experiments conducted using COCO and LVIS datasets reveal that our method is significantly more effective compared to multi-stage pipelines that rely on traditional clustering algorithms or use pre-extracted crops. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying our method to a large-scale Visual Genome dataset, where our network successfully learns to detect various semantic classes without explicit supervision.

 - **Abstract**
 Current referring expression comprehension algorithms can effectively detect or segment objects indicated by nouns, but how to understand verb reference is still under-explored. As such, we study the challenging problem of task oriented detection, which aims to find objects that best afford an action indicated by verbs like sit comfortably on. Towards a finer localization that better serves downstream applications like robot interaction, we extend the problem into task oriented instance segmentation. A unique requirement of this task is to select preferred candidates among possible alternatives. Thus we resort to the transformer architecture which naturally models pair-wise query relationships with attention, leading to the TOIST method. In order to leverage pre-trained noun referring expression comprehension models and the fact that we can access privileged noun ground truth during training, a novel noun-pronoun distillation framework is proposed. Noun prototypes are generated in an unsupervised manner and contextual pronoun features are trained to select prototypes. As such, the network remains noun-agnostic during inference. We evaluate TOIST on the large-scale task oriented dataset COCO-Tasks and achieve +10.9% higher $\rm{mAP^{box}}$ than the best-reported results. The proposed noun-pronoun distillation can boost $\rm{mAP^{box}}$ and $\rm{mAP^{mask}}$ by +2.8% and +3.8%. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/TOIST.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10133
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10133
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose STAMP, an end-to-end 3-party MPC protocol for efficient privacy-preserving machine learning inference assisted by a lightweight TEE (LTEE), which will be far easier to secure and deploy than today's large TEEs. STAMP provides three main advantages over the state-of-the-art; (i) STAMP achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art MPC protocols, with only a small \LTEE that is comparable to a discrete security chip such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or on-chip security subsystems in SoCs similar to the Apple enclave processor. In a semi-honest setting with WAN/GPU, STAMP is 4$\times$-63$\times$ faster than Falcon (PoPETs'21) and AriaNN (PoPETs'22) and 3.8$\times$-12$\times$ more communication efficient. We achieve even higher performance improvements in a malicious setting. (ii) STAMP guarantees security with abort against malicious adversaries under honest majority assumption. (iii) STAMP is not limited by the size of secure memory in a TEE and can support high-capacity modern neural networks like ResNet18 and Transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 The extraction of aspect terms is a critical step in fine-grained sentiment analysis of text. Existing approaches for this task have yielded impressive results when the training and testing data are from the same domain. However, these methods show a drastic decrease in performance when applied to cross-domain settings where the domain of the testing data differs from that of the training data. To address this lack of extensibility and robustness, we propose a novel approach for automatically constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs that contain information relevant to the identification of aspect terms. We introduce a methodology for injecting information from these knowledge graphs into Transformer models, including two alternative mechanisms for knowledge insertion: via query enrichment and via manipulation of attention patterns. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for cross-domain aspect term extraction using our approach and investigate how the amount of external knowledge available to the Transformer impacts model performance.

 - **Abstract**
 The generalization with respect to domain shifts, as they frequently appear in applications such as autonomous driving, is one of the remaining big challenges for deep learning models. Therefore, we propose an intra-source style augmentation (ISSA) method to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation. Our method is based on a novel masked noise encoder for StyleGAN2 inversion. The model learns to faithfully reconstruct the image preserving its semantic layout through noise prediction. Random masking of the estimated noise enables the style mixing capability of our model, i.e. it allows to alter the global appearance without affecting the semantic layout of an image. Using the proposed masked noise encoder to randomize style and content combinations in the training set, ISSA effectively increases the diversity of training data and reduces spurious correlation. As a result, we achieve up to $12.4\%$ mIoU improvements on driving-scene semantic segmentation under different types of data shifts, i.e., changing geographic locations, adverse weather conditions, and day to night. ISSA is model-agnostic and straightforwardly applicable with CNNs and Transformers. It is also complementary to other domain generalization techniques, e.g., it improves the recent state-of-the-art solution RobustNet by $3\%$ mIoU in Cityscapes to Dark Z\"urich.

 - **Abstract**
 Training deep learning models can be computationally expensive. Prior works have shown that increasing the batch size can potentially lead to better overall throughput. However, the batch size is frequently limited by the accelerator memory capacity due to the activations/feature maps stored for the training backward pass, as larger batch sizes require larger feature maps to be stored. Transformer-based models, which have recently seen a surge in popularity due to their good performance and applicability to a variety of tasks, have a similar problem. To remedy this issue, we propose Tempo, a new approach to efficiently use accelerator (e.g., GPU) memory resources for training Transformer-based models. Our approach provides drop-in replacements for the GELU, LayerNorm, and Attention layers, reducing the memory usage and ultimately leading to more efficient training. We implement Tempo and evaluate the throughput, memory usage, and accuracy/loss on the BERT Large pre-training task. We demonstrate that Tempo enables up to 2x higher batch sizes and 16% higher training throughput over the state-of-the-art baseline. We also evaluate Tempo on GPT2 and RoBERTa models, showing 19% and 26% speedup over the baseline.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that most of the conventional video question answering (VideoQA) datasets consist of easy questions requiring simple reasoning processes. However, long videos inevitably contain complex and compositional semantic structures along with the spatio-temporal axis, which requires a model to understand the compositional structures inherent in the videos. In this paper, we suggest a new compositional VideoQA method based on transformer architecture with a deformable attention mechanism to address the complex VideoQA tasks. The deformable attentions are introduced to sample a subset of informative visual features from the dense visual feature map to cover a temporally long range of frames efficiently. Furthermore, the dependency structure within the complex question sentences is also combined with the language embeddings to readily understand the relations among question words. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the suggested dense but efficient model outperforms other baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) achieve remarkable performances on a variety of NLU tasks, but are also prone to generating toxic texts such as insults, threats, and profanities which limit their adaptations to the real-world applications. To overcome this issue, a few text generation approaches aim to detoxify toxic texts with additional LMs or perturbations. However, previous methods require excessive memory, computations, and time which are serious bottlenecks in their real-world application. To address such limitations, we propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent space of an original Transformer LM to a discriminative latent space on which the texts are well-separated by their attributes, with the help of a projection block and a discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to be non-toxic with minimal memory and computation overhead. We validate our model, Attribute-Discriminative Language Model (ADLM) on detoxified language and dialogue generation tasks, on which our method significantly outperforms baselines both in performance and efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Current transformer language models (LM) are large-scale models with billions of parameters. They have been shown to provide high performances on a variety of tasks but are also prone to shortcut learning and bias. Addressing such incorrect model behavior via parameter adjustments is very costly. This is particularly problematic for updating dynamic concepts, such as moral values, which vary culturally or interpersonally. In this work, we question the current common practice of storing all information in the model parameters and propose the Revision Transformer (RiT) employing information retrieval to facilitate easy model updating. The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction. We exemplify RiT on a moral dataset and simulate user feedback demonstrating strong performance in model revision even with small data. This way, users can easily design a model regarding their preferences, paving the way for more transparent and personalized AI models.
### The Devil in Linear Transformer

 - **Abstract**
 Linear transformers aim to reduce the quadratic space-time complexity of vanilla transformers. However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e., BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical NLP tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbolic music generation aims to generate music scores automatically. A recent trend is to use Transformer or its variants in music generation, which is, however, suboptimal, because the full attention cannot efficiently model the typically long music sequences (e.g., over 10,000 tokens), and the existing models have shortcomings in generating musical repetition structures. In this paper, we propose Museformer, a Transformer with a novel fine- and coarse-grained attention for music generation. Specifically, with the fine-grained attention, a token of a specific bar directly attends to all the tokens of the bars that are most relevant to music structures (e.g., the previous 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th bars, selected via similarity statistics); with the coarse-grained attention, a token only attends to the summarization of the other bars rather than each token of them so as to reduce the computational cost. The advantages are two-fold. First, it can capture both music structure-related correlations via the fine-grained attention, and other contextual information via the coarse-grained attention. Second, it is efficient and can model over 3X longer music sequences compared to its full-attention counterpart. Both objective and subjective experimental results demonstrate its ability to generate long music sequences with high quality and better structures.

 - **Abstract**
 While the Vision Transformer has been used in gait recognition, its application in multi-view gait recognition is still limited. Different views significantly affect the extraction and identification accuracy of the characteristics of gait contour. To address this, this paper proposes a Siamese Mobile Vision Transformer (SMViT). This model not only focuses on the local characteristics of the human gait space but also considers the characteristics of long-distance attention associations, which can extract multi-dimensional step status characteristics. In addition, it describes how different perspectives affect gait characteristics and generate reliable perspective feature relationship factors. The average recognition rate of SMViT on the CASIA B data set reached 96.4%. The experimental results show that SMViT can attain state-of-the-art performance compared to advanced step recognition models such as GaitGAN, Multi_view GAN, Posegait and other gait recognition models.

 - **Abstract**
 Representation learning for sketch-based image retrieval has mostly been tackled by learning embeddings that discard modality-specific information. As instances from different modalities can often provide complementary information describing the underlying concept, we propose a cross-attention framework for Vision Transformers (XModalViT) that fuses modality-specific information instead of discarding them. Our framework first maps paired datapoints from the individual photo and sketch modalities to fused representations that unify information from both modalities. We then decouple the input space of the aforementioned modality fusion network into independent encoders of the individual modalities via contrastive and relational cross-modal knowledge distillation. Such encoders can then be applied to downstream tasks like cross-modal retrieval. We demonstrate the expressive capacity of the learned representations by performing a wide range of experiments and achieving state-of-the-art results on three fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval benchmarks: Shoe-V2, Chair-V2 and Sketchy. Implementation is available at https://github.com/abhrac/xmodal-vit.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the problem of action-conditioned generation of human motion sequences. Existing work falls into two categories: forecast models conditioned on observed past motions, or generative models conditioned on action labels and duration only. In contrast, we generate motion conditioned on observations of arbitrary length, including none. To solve this generalized problem, we propose PoseGPT, an auto-regressive transformer-based approach which internally compresses human motion into quantized latent sequences. An auto-encoder first maps human motion to latent index sequences in a discrete space, and vice-versa. Inspired by the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), we propose to train a GPT-like model for next-index prediction in that space; this allows PoseGPT to output distributions on possible futures, with or without conditioning on past motion. The discrete and compressed nature of the latent space allows the GPT-like model to focus on long-range signal, as it removes low-level redundancy in the input signal. Predicting discrete indices also alleviates the common pitfall of predicting averaged poses, a typical failure case when regressing continuous values, as the average of discrete targets is not a target itself. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on HumanAct12, a standard but small scale dataset, as well as on BABEL, a recent large scale MoCap dataset, and on GRAB, a human-object interactions dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Masked image modeling has demonstrated great potential to eliminate the label-hungry problem of training large-scale vision Transformers, achieving impressive performance on various downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a unified view of masked image modeling after revisiting existing methods. Under the unified view, we introduce a simple yet effective method, termed as MaskDistill, which reconstructs normalized semantic features from teacher models at the masked positions, conditioning on corrupted input images. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that MaskDistill achieves comparable or superior performance than state-of-the-art methods. When using the huge vision Transformer and pretraining 300 epochs, MaskDistill obtains 88.3% fine-tuning top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k (224 size) and 58.8% semantic segmentation mIoU metric on ADE20k (512 size). The code and pretrained models will be available at https://aka.ms/unimim.

 - **Abstract**
 Context-aware recommendation systems improve upon classical recommender systems by including, in the modelling, a user's behaviour. Research into context-aware recommendation systems has previously only considered the sequential ordering of items as contextual information. However, there is a wealth of unexploited additional multi-modal information available in auxiliary knowledge related to items. This study extends the existing research by evaluating a multi-modal recommendation system that exploits the inclusion of comprehensive auxiliary knowledge related to an item. The empirical results explore extracting vector representations (embeddings) from unstructured and structured data using data2vec. The fused embeddings are then used to train several state-of-the-art transformer architectures for sequential user-item representations. The analysis of the experimental results shows a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy, which confirms the effectiveness of including auxiliary information in a context-aware recommendation system. We report a 4% and 11% increase in the NDCG score for long and short user sequence datasets, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Click-Through Rate prediction (CTR) is a crucial task in recommender systems, and it gained considerable attention in the past few years. The primary purpose of recent research emphasizes obtaining meaningful and powerful representations through mining low and high feature interactions using various components such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), CrossNets, or transformer blocks. In this work, we propose the Deep Multi-Representation model (DeepMR) that jointly trains a mixture of two powerful feature representation learning components, namely DNNs and multi-head self-attentions. Furthermore, DeepMR integrates the novel residual with zero initialization (ReZero) connections to the DNN and the multi-head self-attention components for learning superior input representations. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of click-through rate prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Algorithmic reasoning requires capabilities which are most naturally understood through recurrent models of computation, like the Turing machine. However, Transformer models, while lacking recurrence, are able to perform such reasoning using far fewer layers than the number of reasoning steps. This raises the question: what solutions are these shallow and non-recurrent models finding? We investigate this question in the setting of learning automata, discrete dynamical systems naturally suited to recurrent modeling and expressing algorithmic tasks. Our theoretical results completely characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a shallow Transformer with only $o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length $T$. By representing automata using the algebraic structure of their underlying transformation semigroups, we obtain $O(\log T)$-depth simulators for all automata and $O(1)$-depth simulators for all automata whose associated groups are solvable. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training Transformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut solutions can be learned via standard training. We further investigate the brittleness of these solutions and propose potential mitigations.

We evaluate TOIST on the large-scale task oriented dataset COCO-Tasks and achieve +10.9% higher $\rm{mAP^{box}}$ than the best-reported results. The proposed noun-pronoun distillation can boost $\rm{mAP^{box}}$ and $\rm{mAP^{mask}}$ by +2.8% and +3.8%. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/TOIST.

 - **Abstract**
 The generalization with respect to domain shifts, as they frequently appear in applications such as autonomous driving, is one of the remaining big challenges for deep learning models. Therefore, we propose an intra-source style augmentation (ISSA) method to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation. Our method is based on a novel masked noise encoder for StyleGAN2 inversion. The model learns to faithfully reconstruct the image preserving its semantic layout through noise prediction. Random masking of the estimated noise enables the style mixing capability of our model, i.e. it allows to alter the global appearance without affecting the semantic layout of an image. Using the proposed masked noise encoder to randomize style and content combinations in the training set, ISSA effectively increases the diversity of training data and reduces spurious correlation. As a result, we achieve up to $12.4\%$ mIoU improvements on driving-scene semantic segmentation under different types of data shifts, i.e., changing geographic locations, adverse weather conditions, and day to night. ISSA is model-agnostic and straightforwardly applicable with CNNs and Transformers. It is also complementary to other domain generalization techniques, e.g., it improves the recent state-of-the-art solution RobustNet by $3\%$ mIoU in Cityscapes to Dark Z\"urich.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the problem of domain adaptation in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Towards this, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy called Gradual Batch Alternation that can adapt from a large labeled source domain to an insufficiently labeled target domain. The idea is to initiate the training with the batch of samples from the source and target domain data in an alternate fashion, but then gradually reduce the amount of the source domain data over time as the training progresses. This way the model slowly shifts towards the target domain and eventually better adapt to it. The domain adaptation experiments for 3D object detection on four benchmark autonomous driving datasets, namely ONCE, PandaSet, Waymo, and nuScenes, demonstrate significant performance gains over prior arts and strong baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a framework for planning in unknown dynamic environments with probabilistic safety guarantees using conformal prediction. Particularly, we design a model predictive controller (MPC) that uses i) trajectory predictions of the dynamic environment, and ii) prediction regions quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. To obtain prediction regions, we use conformal prediction, a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification, that requires availability of offline trajectory data - a reasonable assumption in many applications such as autonomous driving. The prediction regions are valid, i.e., they hold with a user-defined probability, so that the MPC is provably safe. We illustrate the results in the self-driving car simulator CARLA at a pedestrian-filled intersection. The strength of our approach is compatibility with state of the art trajectory predictors, e.g., RNNs and LSTMs, while making no assumptions on the underlying trajectory-generating distribution. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such a setting.

 - **Abstract**
 With the development of neural networks and the increasing popularity of automatic driving, the calibration of the LiDAR and the camera has attracted more and more attention. This calibration task is multi-modal, where the rich color and texture information captured by the camera and the accurate three-dimensional spatial information from the LiDAR is incredibly significant for downstream tasks. Current research interests mainly focus on obtaining accurate calibration results through information fusion. However, they seldom analyze whether the calibrated results are correct or not, which could be of significant importance in real-world applications. For example, in large-scale production, the LiDARs and the cameras of each smart car have to get well-calibrated as the car leaves the production line, while in the rest of the car life period, the poses of the LiDARs and cameras should also get continually supervised to ensure the security. To this end, this paper proposes a self-checking algorithm to judge whether the extrinsic parameters are well-calibrated by introducing a binary classification network based on the fused information from the camera and the LiDAR. Moreover, since there is no such dataset for the task in this work, we further generate a new dataset branch from the KITTI dataset tailored for the task. Our experiments on the proposed dataset branch demonstrate the performance of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the significance of continually checking the calibrated extrinsic parameters for autonomous driving. The code is open-sourced on the Github website at https://github.com/OpenCalib/LiDAR2camera_self-check.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-evolution is indispensable to realize full autonomous driving. This paper presents a self-evolving decision-making system based on the Integrated Decision and Control (IDC), an advanced framework built on reinforcement learning (RL). First, an RL algorithm called constrained mixed policy gradient (CMPG) is proposed to consistently upgrade the driving policy of the IDC. It adapts the MPG under the penalty method so that it can solve constrained optimization problems using both the data and model. Second, an attention-based encoding (ABE) method is designed to tackle the state representation issue. It introduces an embedding network for feature extraction and a weighting network for feature fusion, fulfilling order-insensitive encoding and importance distinguishing of road users. Finally, by fusing CMPG and ABE, we develop the first data-driven decision and control system under the IDC architecture, and deploy the system on a fully-functional self-driving vehicle running in daily operation. Experiment results show that boosting by data, the system can achieve better driving ability over model-based methods. It also demonstrates safe, efficient and smart driving behavior in various complex scenes at a signalized intersection with real mixed traffic flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Image guided depth completion aims to recover per-pixel dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements with the help of aligned color images, which has a wide range of applications from robotics to autonomous driving. However, the 3D nature of sparse-to-dense depth completion has not been fully explored by previous methods. In this work, we propose a Graph Convolution based Spatial Propagation Network (GraphCSPN) as a general approach for depth completion. First, unlike previous methods, we leverage convolution neural networks as well as graph neural networks in a complementary way for geometric representation learning. In addition, the proposed networks explicitly incorporate learnable geometric constraints to regularize the propagation process performed in three-dimensional space rather than in two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, we construct the graph utilizing sequences of feature patches, and update it dynamically with an edge attention module during propagation, so as to better capture both the local neighboring features and global relationships over long distance. Extensive experiments on both indoor NYU-Depth-v2 and outdoor KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, especially when compared in the case of using only a few propagation steps. Code and models are available at the project page.
