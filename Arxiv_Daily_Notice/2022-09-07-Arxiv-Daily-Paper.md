 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we propose a novel visual localization approach to accurately estimate six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) poses of the robot within the 3D LiDAR map based on visual data from an RGB camera. The 3D map is obtained utilizing an advanced LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm capable of collecting a precise sparse map. The features extracted from the camera images are compared with the points of the 3D map, and then the geometric optimization problem is being solved to achieve precise visual localization. Our approach allows employing a scout robot equipped with an expensive LiDAR only once - for mapping of the environment, and multiple operational robots with only RGB cameras onboard - for performing mission tasks, with the localization accuracy higher than common camera-based solutions. The proposed method was tested on the custom dataset collected in the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). During the process of assessing the localization accuracy, we managed to achieve centimeter-level accuracy; the median translation error was as low as 1.3 cm. The precise positioning achieved with only cameras makes possible the usage of autonomous mobile robots to solve the most complex tasks that require high localization accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Robots are integrating more huge-size models to enrich functions and improve accuracy, which leads to out-of-control computing pressure. And thus robots are encountering bottlenecks in computing power and battery capacity. Fog or cloud robotics is one of the most anticipated theories to address these issues. Approaches of cloud robotics have developed from system-level to node-level. However, the present node-level systems are not flexible enough to dynamically adapt to changing conditions. To address this, we present ElasticROS, which evolves the present node-level systems into an algorithm-level one. ElasticROS is based on ROS and ROS2. For fog and cloud robotics, it is the first robot operating system with algorithm-level collaborative computing. ElasticROS develops elastic collaborative computing to achieve adaptability to dynamic conditions. The collaborative computing algorithm is the core and challenge of ElasticROS. We abstract the problem and then propose an algorithm named ElasAction to address. It is a dynamic action decision algorithm based on online learning, which determines how robots and servers cooperate. The algorithm dynamically updates parameters to adapt to changes of conditions where the robot is currently in. It achieves elastically distributing of computing tasks to robots and servers according to configurations. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound of the ElasAction is sublinear, which guarantees its convergence and thus enables ElasticROS to be stable in its elasticity. Finally, we conducted experiments with ElasticROS on common tasks of robotics, including SLAM, grasping and human-robot dialogue, and then measured its performances in latency, CPU usage and power consumption. The algorithm-level ElasticROS performs significantly better than the present node-level system.

 - **Abstract**
 In the proposed study, we describe an approach to improving the computational efficiency and robustness of visual SLAM algorithms on mobile robots with multiple cameras and limited computational power by implementing an intermediate layer between the cameras and the SLAM pipeline. In this layer, the images are classified using a ResNet18-based neural network regarding their applicability to the robot localization. The network is trained on a six-camera dataset collected in the campus of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). For training, we use the images and ORB features that were successfully matched with subsequent frame of the same camera ("good" keypoints or features). The results have shown that the network is able to accurately determine the optimal images for ORB-SLAM2, and implementing the proposed approach in the SLAM pipeline can help significantly increase the number of images the SLAM algorithm can localize on, and improve the overall robustness of visual SLAM. The experiments on operation time state that the proposed approach is at least 6 times faster compared to using ORB extractor and feature matcher when operated on CPU, and more than 30 times faster when run on GPU. The network evaluation has shown at least 90% accuracy in recognizing images with a big number of "good" ORB keypoints. The use of the proposed approach allowed to maintain a high number of features throughout the dataset by robustly switching from cameras with feature-poor streams.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous agents require self-localization to navigate in unknown environments. They can use Visual Odometry (VO) to estimate self-motion and localize themselves using visual sensors. This motion-estimation strategy is not compromised by drift as inertial sensors or slippage as wheel encoders. However, VO with conventional cameras is computationally demanding, limiting its application in systems with strict low-latency, -memory, and -energy requirements. Using event-based cameras and neuromorphic computing hardware offers a promising low-power solution to the VO problem. However, conventional algorithms for VO are not readily convertible to neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we present a VO algorithm built entirely of neuronal building blocks suitable for neuromorphic implementation. The building blocks are groups of neurons representing vectors in the computational framework of Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) which was proposed as an abstraction layer to program neuromorphic hardware. The VO network we propose generates and stores a working memory of the presented visual environment. It updates this working memory while at the same time estimating the changing location and orientation of the camera. We demonstrate how VSA can be leveraged as a computing paradigm for neuromorphic robotics. Moreover, our results represent an important step towards using neuromorphic computing hardware for fast and power-efficient VO and the related task of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We validate this approach experimentally in a robotic task and with an event-based dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a method for the robust selection of measurements in a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. Existing methods check consistency or compatibility on a pairwise basis, however many measurement types are not sufficiently constrained in a pairwise scenario to determine if either measurement is inconsistent with the other. This paper presents group-$k$ consistency maximization (G$k$CM) that estimates the largest set of measurements that is internally group-$k$ consistent. Solving for the largest set of group-$k$ consistent measurements can be formulated as an instance of the maximum clique problem on generalized graphs and can be solved by adapting current methods. This paper evaluates the performance of G$k$CM using simulated data and compares it to pairwise consistency maximization (PCM) presented in previous work.

 - **Abstract**
 In the existing methods, LiDAR odometry shows superior performance, but visual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally, the task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images. However, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar geometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of pseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The pseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image into the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation. Compared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the stereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D structure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct than the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point cloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted. Most previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud as input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline takes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for the error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D geometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is also used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an image-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to ease the process of library management many technologies have been adopted but most of them focus on inventory management. There has hardly been any progress of automation in the field of issuing and returning books to the library on time. In colleges and schools, hostellers often forget to timely return the issued books back to the library. To solve the above issue and to ensure timely submission of the issued books, this work develops a Book-Bot which solves these complexities. The bot can commute from point A to point B, scan and verify QR Codes and Barcodes. The bot will have a certain payload capacity for carrying books. The QR code and Barcode scanning will be enabled by a Pi Camera, OpenCV and Raspberry Pi, thus making the exchange of books safe and secure. The odometry maneuvers of the bot will be controlled manually via a Blynk App. This paper focuses on how human intervention can be reduced and automates the issue part of library management system with the help of a bot.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we analyze the effect of time delay dynamics on controller design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with vision based navigation. Time delay is an inevitable phenomenon in cyber-physical systems, and has important implications on controller design and trajectory generation for UAVs. The impact of time delay on UAV dynamics increases with the use of the slower vision based navigation stack. We show that the existing models in the literature, which exclude time delay, are unsuitable for controller tuning since a trivial solution for minimizing an error cost functional always exists. The trivial solution that we identify suggests use of infinite controller gains to achieve optimal performance, which contradicts practical findings. We avoid such shortcomings by introducing a novel nonlinear time delay model for UAVs, and then obtain a set of linear decoupled models corresponding to each of the UAV control loops. The cost functional of the linearized time delay model of angular and altitude dynamics is analyzed, and in contrast to the delay-free models, we show the existence of finite optimal controller parameters. Due to the use of time delay models, we experimentally show that the proposed model accurately represents system stability limits. Due to time delay consideration, we achieved a tracking results of RMSE 5.01 cm when tracking a lemniscate trajectory with a peak velocity of 2.09 m/s using visual odometry (VO) based UAV navigation, which is on par with the state-of-the-art.

 - **Abstract**
 Factor graph is a graph representing the factorization of a probability distribution function, and has been utilized in many autonomous machine computing tasks, such as localization, tracking, planning and control etc. We are developing an architecture with the goal of using factor graph as a common abstraction for most, if not, all autonomous machine computing tasks. If successful, the architecture would provide a very simple interface of mapping autonomous machine functions to the underlying compute hardware. As a first step of such an attempt, this paper presents our most recent work of developing a factor graph accelerator for LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), an essential task in many autonomous machines, such as autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. By modeling LIO as a factor graph, the proposed accelerator not only supports multi-sensor fusion such as LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS, etc., but solves the global optimization problem of robot navigation in batch or incremental modes. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design significantly improves the real-time performance and energy efficiency of autonomous machine navigation systems. The initial success suggests the potential of generalizing the factor graph architecture as a common abstraction for autonomous machine computing, including tracking, planning, and control etc.

 - **Abstract**
 Effectively preserving and encoding structure features from objects in irregular and sparse LiDAR points is a key challenge to 3D object detection on point cloud. Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on many 2D and even 3D vision tasks. Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution kernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the unrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial structure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a simple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and all the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic operation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local structure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose a Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local structure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the local structure. Compared to the self-attention mechanism in traditional Transformer, SEFormer learns different feature transformations for value points based on the relative directions and distances to the query point. Then we propose a SEFormer based network for high-performance 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve SOTA results on Waymo Open Dataset, the largest 3D detection benchmark for autonomous driving. Specifically, SEFormer achieves 79.02% mAP, which is 1.2% higher than existing works. We will release the codes.

 - **Abstract**
 3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) ensures consistency during continuous dynamic detection, conducive to subsequent motion planning and navigation tasks in autonomous driving. However, camera-based methods suffer in the case of occlusions and it can be challenging to accurately track the irregular motion of objects for LiDAR-based methods. Some fusion methods work well but do not consider the untrustworthy issue of appearance features under occlusion. At the same time, the false detection problem also significantly affects tracking. As such, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion 3D MOT framework based on the Combined Appearance-Motion Optimization (CAMO-MOT), which uses both camera and LiDAR data and significantly reduces tracking failures caused by occlusion and false detection. For occlusion problems, we are the first to propose an occlusion head to select the best object appearance features multiple times effectively, reducing the influence of occlusions. To decrease the impact of false detection in tracking, we design a motion cost matrix based on confidence scores which improve the positioning and object prediction accuracy in 3D space. As existing multi-object tracking methods only consider a single category, we also propose to build a multi-category loss to implement multi-object tracking in multi-category scenes. A series of validation experiments are conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes tracking benchmarks. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the lowest identity switches (IDS) value (23 for Car and 137 for Pedestrian) among all multi-modal MOT methods on the KITTI test dataset. And our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among all algorithms on the nuScenes test dataset with 75.3% AMOTA.

 Neural Radiance Fields employ simple volume rendering as a way to overcome the challenges of differentiating through ray-triangle intersections by leveraging a probabilistic notion of visibility. This is achieved by assuming the scene is composed by a cloud of light-emitting particles whose density changes in space. This technical report summarizes the derivations for differentiable volume rendering. It is a condensed version of previous reports, but rewritten in the context of NeRF, and adopting its commonly used notation.

 - **Abstract**
 The distributed computation of a Nash equilibrium in aggregative games is gaining increased traction in recent years. Of particular interest is the mediator-free scenario where individual players only access or observe the decisions of their neighbors due to practical constraints. Given the competitive rivalry among participating players, protecting the privacy of individual players becomes imperative when sensitive information is involved. We propose a fully distributed equilibrium-computation approach for aggregative games that can achieve both rigorous differential privacy and guaranteed computation accuracy of the Nash equilibrium. This is in sharp contrast to existing differential-privacy solutions for aggregative games that have to either sacrifice the accuracy of equilibrium computation to gain rigorous privacy guarantees, or allow the cumulative privacy budget to grow unbounded, hence losing privacy guarantees, as iteration proceeds. Our approach uses independent noises across players, thus making it effective even when adversaries have access to all shared messages as well as the underlying algorithm structure. The encryption-free nature of the proposed approach, also ensures efficiency in computation and communication. The approach is also applicable in stochastic aggregative games, able to ensure both rigorous differential privacy and guaranteed computation accuracy of the Nash equilibrium when individual players only have stochastic estimates of their pseudo-gradient mappings. Numerical comparisons with existing counterparts confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic classification of pigmented, non-pigmented, and depigmented non-melanocytic skin lesions have garnered lots of attention in recent years. However, imaging variations in skin texture, lesion shape, depigmentation contrast, lighting condition, etc. hinder robust feature extraction, affecting classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network that exploits input data for robust feature extraction. Specifically, we analyze the convolutional network's behavior (field-of-view) to find the location of deep supervision for improved feature extraction. To achieve this, first, we perform activation mapping to generate an object mask, highlighting the input regions most critical for classification output generation. Then the network layer whose layer-wise effective receptive field matches the approximated object shape in the object mask is selected as our focus for deep supervision. Utilizing different types of convolutional feature extractors and classifiers on three melanoma detection datasets and two vitiligo detection datasets, we verify the effectiveness of our new method.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a long history of side channels in the memory hierarchy of modern CPUs. Especially the cache side channel is widely used in the context of transient execution attacks and covert channels. Therefore, many secure cache architectures have been proposed. Most of these architectures aim to make the construction of eviction sets infeasible by randomizing the address-to-cache mapping. In this paper, we investigate the peculiarities of write instructions in recent CPUs. We identify Write+Write, a new side channel on Intel CPUs that leaks whether two addresses contend for the same cache set. We show how Write+Write can be used for rapid construction of eviction sets on current cache architectures. Moreover, we replicate the Write+Write effect in gem5 and demonstrate on the example of ScatterCache how it can be exploited to efficiently attack state-of-the-art cache randomization schemes. In addition to the Write+Write side channel, we show how Write-After-Write effects can be leveraged to efficiently synchronize covert channel communication across CPU cores. This yields the potential for much more stealthy covert channel communication than before.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate abnormality localization in chest X-rays (CXR) can benefit the clinical diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. However, the lesion-level annotation can only be performed by experienced radiologists, and it is tedious and time-consuming, thus difficult to acquire. Such a situation results in a difficulty to develop a fully-supervised abnormality localization system for CXR. In this regard, we propose to train the CXR abnormality localization framework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class (PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level bounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point annotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for abnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost. Particularly, the core idea behind our PBC is to learn a robust and accurate mapping from the point annotations to the bounding boxes against the variance of annotated points. To achieve that, a regularization term, namely multi-point consistency, is proposed, which drives the model to generate the consistent bounding box from different point annotations inside the same abnormality. Furthermore, a self-supervision, termed symmetric consistency, is also proposed to deeply exploit the useful information from the weakly annotated data for abnormality localization. Experimental results on RSNA and VinDr-CXR datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method. When less than 20% box-level labels are used for training, an improvement of ~5 in mAP can be achieved by our PBC, compared to the current state-of-the-art method (i.e., Point DETR).

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous agents require self-localization to navigate in unknown environments. They can use Visual Odometry (VO) to estimate self-motion and localize themselves using visual sensors. This motion-estimation strategy is not compromised by drift as inertial sensors or slippage as wheel encoders. However, VO with conventional cameras is computationally demanding, limiting its application in systems with strict low-latency, -memory, and -energy requirements. Using event-based cameras and neuromorphic computing hardware offers a promising low-power solution to the VO problem. However, conventional algorithms for VO are not readily convertible to neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we present a VO algorithm built entirely of neuronal building blocks suitable for neuromorphic implementation. The building blocks are groups of neurons representing vectors in the computational framework of Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) which was proposed as an abstraction layer to program neuromorphic hardware. The VO network we propose generates and stores a working memory of the presented visual environment. It updates this working memory while at the same time estimating the changing location and orientation of the camera. We demonstrate how VSA can be leveraged as a computing paradigm for neuromorphic robotics. Moreover, our results represent an important step towards using neuromorphic computing hardware for fast and power-efficient VO and the related task of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We validate this approach experimentally in a robotic task and with an event-based dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Factor graph is a graph representing the factorization of a probability distribution function, and has been utilized in many autonomous machine computing tasks, such as localization, tracking, planning and control etc. We are developing an architecture with the goal of using factor graph as a common abstraction for most, if not, all autonomous machine computing tasks. If successful, the architecture would provide a very simple interface of mapping autonomous machine functions to the underlying compute hardware. As a first step of such an attempt, this paper presents our most recent work of developing a factor graph accelerator for LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), an essential task in many autonomous machines, such as autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. By modeling LIO as a factor graph, the proposed accelerator not only supports multi-sensor fusion such as LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS, etc., but solves the global optimization problem of robot navigation in batch or incremental modes. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design significantly improves the real-time performance and energy efficiency of autonomous machine navigation systems. The initial success suggests the potential of generalizing the factor graph architecture as a common abstraction for autonomous machine computing, including tracking, planning, and control etc.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-supervised methods have shown tremendous success in the field of computer vision, including applications in remote sensing and medical imaging. Most popular contrastive-loss based methods like SimCLR, MoCo, MoCo-v2 use multiple views of the same image by applying contrived augmentations on the image to create positive pairs and contrast them with negative examples. Although these techniques work well, most of these techniques have been tuned on ImageNet (and similar computer vision datasets). While there have been some attempts to capture a richer set of deformations in the positive samples, in this work, we explore a promising alternative to generating positive examples for remote sensing data within the contrastive learning framework. Images captured from different sensors at the same location and nearby timestamps can be thought of as strongly augmented instances of the same scene, thus removing the need to explore and tune a set of hand crafted strong augmentations. In this paper, we propose a simple dual-encoder framework, which is pre-trained on a large unlabeled dataset (~1M) of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image pairs. We test the embeddings on two remote sensing downstream tasks: flood segmentation and land cover mapping, and empirically show that embeddings learnt from this technique outperform the conventional technique of collecting positive examples via aggressive data augmentations.

 We develop an approach to policy selection in active inference that allows us to efficiently search large policy spaces by mapping each policy to its embedding in a vector space. We sample the expected free energy of representative points in the space, then perform a more thorough policy search around the most promising point in this initial sample. We consider various approaches to creating the policy embedding space, and propose using k-means clustering to select representative points. We apply our technique to a goal-oriented graph-traversal problem, for which naive policy selection is intractable for even moderately large graphs.

 This paper presents a method for the robust selection of measurements in a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. Existing methods check consistency or compatibility on a pairwise basis, however many measurement types are not sufficiently constrained in a pairwise scenario to determine if either measurement is inconsistent with the other. This paper presents group-$k$ consistency maximization (G$k$CM) that estimates the largest set of measurements that is internally group-$k$ consistent. Solving for the largest set of group-$k$ consistent measurements can be formulated as an instance of the maximum clique problem on generalized graphs and can be solved by adapting current methods. This paper evaluates the performance of G$k$CM using simulated data and compares it to pairwise consistency maximization (PCM) presented in previous work.

 - **Abstract**
 Image-to-image translation has played an important role in enabling synthetic data for computer vision. However, if the source and target domains have a large semantic mismatch, existing techniques often suffer from source content corruption aka semantic flipping. To address this problem, we propose a new paradigm for image-to-image translation using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), a theoretical framework which defines algebraic operations in a high-dimensional vector (hypervector) space. We introduce VSA-based constraints on adversarial learning for source-to-target translations by learning a hypervector mapping that inverts the translation to ensure consistency with source content. We show both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method improves over other state-of-the-art techniques.

### Data-Assisted Vision-Based Hybrid Control for Robust Stabilization with  Obstacle Avoidance via Learning of Perception Maps

 - **Abstract**
 We study the problem of target stabilization with robust obstacle avoidance in robots and vehicles that have access only to vision-based sensors for the purpose of realtime localization. This problem is particularly challenging due to the topological obstructions induced by the obstacle, which preclude the existence of smooth feedback controllers able to achieve simultaneous stabilization and robust obstacle avoidance. To overcome this issue, we develop a vision-based hybrid controller that switches between two different feedback laws depending on the current position of the vehicle using a hysteresis mechanism and a data-assisted supervisor. The main innovation of the paper is the incorporation of suitable perception maps into the hybrid controller. These maps can be learned from data obtained from cameras in the vehicles and trained via convolutional neural networks (CNN). Under suitable assumptions on this perception map, we establish theoretical guarantees for the trajectories of the vehicle in terms of convergence and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the proposed vision-based hybrid controller is numerically tested under different scenarios, including noisy data, sensors with failures, and cameras with occlusions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we propose a novel visual localization approach to accurately estimate six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) poses of the robot within the 3D LiDAR map based on visual data from an RGB camera. The 3D map is obtained utilizing an advanced LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm capable of collecting a precise sparse map. The features extracted from the camera images are compared with the points of the 3D map, and then the geometric optimization problem is being solved to achieve precise visual localization. Our approach allows employing a scout robot equipped with an expensive LiDAR only once - for mapping of the environment, and multiple operational robots with only RGB cameras onboard - for performing mission tasks, with the localization accuracy higher than common camera-based solutions. The proposed method was tested on the custom dataset collected in the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). During the process of assessing the localization accuracy, we managed to achieve centimeter-level accuracy; the median translation error was as low as 1.3 cm. The precise positioning achieved with only cameras makes possible the usage of autonomous mobile robots to solve the most complex tasks that require high localization accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel underwater system that can perform acoustic ranging between commodity smartphones. To achieve this, we design a real-time underwater ranging protocol that computes the time-of-flight between smartphones. To address the severe underwater multipath, we present a dual-microphone optimization algorithm that can more reliably identify the direct path. Our underwater evaluations show that our system has median errors of 0.48-0.86 m at distances upto 35 m. Further, our system can operate across smartphone model pairs and works in the presence of clock drifts. While existing underwater localization research is targeted for custom hydrophone hardware, we believe that our work breaks new ground by demonstrating a path to bringing underwater ranging capabilities to billions of existing smartphones, without additional hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 In the proposed study, we describe an approach to improving the computational efficiency and robustness of visual SLAM algorithms on mobile robots with multiple cameras and limited computational power by implementing an intermediate layer between the cameras and the SLAM pipeline. In this layer, the images are classified using a ResNet18-based neural network regarding their applicability to the robot localization. The network is trained on a six-camera dataset collected in the campus of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). For training, we use the images and ORB features that were successfully matched with subsequent frame of the same camera ("good" keypoints or features). The results have shown that the network is able to accurately determine the optimal images for ORB-SLAM2, and implementing the proposed approach in the SLAM pipeline can help significantly increase the number of images the SLAM algorithm can localize on, and improve the overall robustness of visual SLAM. The experiments on operation time state that the proposed approach is at least 6 times faster compared to using ORB extractor and feature matcher when operated on CPU, and more than 30 times faster when run on GPU. The network evaluation has shown at least 90% accuracy in recognizing images with a big number of "good" ORB keypoints. The use of the proposed approach allowed to maintain a high number of features throughout the dataset by robustly switching from cameras with feature-poor streams.

 - **Abstract**
 Arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) has been widely applied to locate and classify objects with diverse orientations in remote sensing images. However, the inconsistent features for the localization and classification tasks in AOOD models may lead to ambiguity and low-quality object predictions, which constrains the detection performance. In this paper, an AOOD method called task-wise sampling convolutions (TS-Conv) is proposed. TS-Conv adaptively samples task-wise features from respective sensitive regions and maps these features together in alignment to guide a dynamic label assignment for better predictions. Specifically, sampling positions of the localization convolution in TS-Conv is supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB) prediction associated with spatial coordinates. While sampling positions and convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be adaptively adjusted according to different orientations for improving the orientation robustness of features. Furthermore, a dynamic task-aware label assignment (DTLA) strategy is developed to select optimal candidate positions and assign labels dynamicly according to ranked task-aware scores obtained from TS-Conv. Extensive experiments on several public datasets covering multiple scenes, multimodal images, and multiple categories of objects demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and superior performance of the proposed TS-Conv.

 - **Abstract**
 In stockbreeding of beef cattle, computer vision-based approaches have been widely employed to monitor cattle conditions (e.g. the physical, physiology, and health). To this end, the accurate and effective recognition of cattle action is a prerequisite. Generally, most existing models are confined to individual behavior that uses video-based methods to extract spatial-temporal features for recognizing the individual actions of each cattle. However, there is sociality among cattle and their interaction usually reflects important conditions, e.g. estrus, and also video-based method neglects the real-time capability of the model. Based on this, we tackle the challenging task of real-time recognizing interactions between cattle in a single frame in this paper. The pipeline of our method includes two main modules: Cattle Localization Network and Interaction Recognition Network. At every moment, cattle localization network outputs high-quality interaction proposals from every detected cattle and feeds them into the interaction recognition network with a triple-stream architecture. Such a triple-stream network allows us to fuse different features relevant to recognizing interactions. Specifically, the three kinds of features are a visual feature that extracts the appearance representation of interaction proposals, a geometric feature that reflects the spatial relationship between cattle, and a semantic feature that captures our prior knowledge of the relationship between the individual action and interaction of cattle. In addition, to solve the problem of insufficient quantity of labeled data, we pre-train the model based on self-supervised learning. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation evidences the performance of our framework as an effective method to recognize cattle interaction in real time.

 We introduce a novel technique and an associated high resolution dataset that aims to precisely evaluate wireless signal based indoor positioning algorithms. The technique implements an augmented reality (AR) based positioning system that is used to annotate the wireless signal parameter data samples with high precision position data. We track the position of a practical and low cost navigable setup of cameras and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon in an area decorated with AR markers. We maximize the performance of the AR-based localization by using a redundant number of markers. Video streams captured by the cameras are subjected to a series of marker recognition, subset selection and filtering operations to yield highly precise pose estimations. Our results show that we can reduce the positional error of the AR localization system to a rate under 0.05 meters. The position data are then used to annotate the BLE data that are captured simultaneously by the sensors stationed in the environment, hence, constructing a wireless signal data set with the ground truth, which allows a wireless signal based localization system to be evaluated accurately.

 - **Abstract**
 For microservice applications with detected performance anomalies, localizing root causes based on monitoring data is important to enabling rapid recovery and loss mitigation. Existing research mainly focuses on coarse-grained faulty service localization. However, the fine-grained root cause localization to identify not only faulty service but also the root cause metric in the service is more helpful for operators to fix application anomalies, which is also more challenging. Recently, causal inference (CI) based methods is becoming popular but currently used CI methods have limitations, such as linear causal relations assumption. Therefore, this paper provides a framework named CausalRCA to implement fine-grained, automated, and real-time root cause localization. The CausalRCA works with a gradient-based causal structure learning method to generate weighted causal graphs and a root cause inference method to localize root cause metrics. We conduct coarse-grained and fine-grained root cause localization to validate the localization performance of CausalRCA. Experimental results show that CausalRCA performs best localization accuracy compared with baseline methods, e.g., the average $AC@3$ of the fine-grained root cause metric localization in the faulty service is 0.719, and the average improvement is 17\% compared with baseline methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent increases in aerial image access and volume, increases in computational power, and interest in applications have opened the door to scaling up object detection and domain adaptation research to production. Aerial data sets are very large in size, and each frame of the data set contains a huge number of dense and small objects. Deep learning applications for aerial imagery are behind due to a lack of training data, and researchers have recently turned to domain adaptation (DA) from a labeled data set to an unlabeled data set to alleviate the issue. These factors create two major challenges: the high variety between datasets (e.g. object sizes, class distributions, object feature uniformity, image acquisition, distance, weather conditions), and the size of objects in satellite imagery and subsequent failure of state-of-the-art to capture small objects, local features, and region proposals for densely overlapped objects in satellite image. In this paper, we propose two solutions to these problems: a domain discriminator to better align the local feature space between domains; and a novel pipeline that improves the back-end by spatial pyramid pooling, cross-stage partial network, region proposal network via heatmap-based region proposals, and object localization and identification through a novel image difficulty score that adapts the overall focal loss measure based on the image difficulty. Our proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art method by 7.4%.

 This study presents our approach on the automatic Vietnamese image captioning for healthcare domain in text processing tasks of Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) Challenge 2021, as shown in Figure 1. In recent years, image captioning often employs a convolutional neural network-based architecture as an encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) as a decoder to generate sentences. These models perform remarkably well in different datasets. Our proposed model also has an encoder and a decoder, but we instead use a Swin Transformer in the encoder, and a LSTM combined with an attention module in the decoder. The study presents our training experiments and techniques used during the competition. Our model achieves a BLEU4 score of 0.293 on the vietCap4H dataset, and the score is ranked the 3$^{rd}$ place on the private leaderboard. Our code can be found at \url{https://git.io/JDdJm}.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate and efficient prediction of polymer properties is of great significance in polymer development and design. Conventionally, expensive and time-consuming experiments or simulations are required to evaluate the function of polymers. Recently, Transformer models, equipped with attention mechanisms, have exhibited superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, such methods have not been investigated in polymer sciences. Herein, we report TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer property prediction. Owing to our proposed polymer tokenizer with chemical awareness, TransPolymer can learn representations directly from polymer sequences. The model learns expressive representations by pretraining on a large unlabeled dataset, followed by finetuning the model on downstream datasets concerning various polymer properties. TransPolymer achieves superior performance in all eight datasets and surpasses other baselines significantly on most downstream tasks. Moreover, the improvement by the pretrained TransPolymer over supervised TransPolymer and other language models strengthens the significant benefits of pretraining on large unlabeled data in representation learning. Experiment results further demonstrate the important role of the attention mechanism in understanding polymer sequences. We highlight this model as a promising computational tool for promoting rational polymer design and understanding structure-property relationships in a data science view.

 - **Abstract**
 Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow often impair the quality of captured images, causing detection networks trained on normal images to generalize poorly in these scenarios. In this paper, we raise an intriguing question - if the combination of image restoration and object detection, can boost the performance of cutting-edge detectors in adverse weather conditions. To answer it, we propose an effective yet unified detection paradigm that bridges these two subtasks together via dynamic enhancement learning to discern objects in adverse weather conditions, called TogetherNet. Different from existing efforts that intuitively apply image dehazing/deraining as a pre-processing step, TogetherNet considers a multi-task joint learning problem. Following the joint learning scheme, clean features produced by the restoration network can be shared to learn better object detection in the detection network, thus helping TogetherNet enhance the detection capacity in adverse weather conditions. Besides the joint learning architecture, we design a new Dynamic Transformer Feature Enhancement module to improve the feature extraction and representation capabilities of TogetherNet. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our TogetherNet outperforms the state-of-the-art detection approaches by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 Human drivers have distinct driving techniques, knowledge, and sentiments due to unique driving traits. Driver drowsiness has been a serious issue endangering road safety; therefore, it is essential to design an effective drowsiness detection algorithm to bypass road accidents. Miscellaneous research efforts have been approached the problem of detecting anomalous human driver behaviour to examine the frontal face of the driver and automobile dynamics via computer vision techniques. Still, the conventional methods cannot capture complicated driver behaviour features. However, with the origin of deep learning architectures, a substantial amount of research has also been executed to analyze and recognize driver's drowsiness using neural network algorithms. This paper introduces a novel framework based on vision transformers and YoloV5 architectures for driver drowsiness recognition. A custom YoloV5 pre-trained architecture is proposed for face extraction with the aim of extracting Region of Interest (ROI). Owing to the limitations of previous architectures, this paper introduces vision transformers for binary image classification which is trained and validated on a public dataset UTA-RLDD. The model had achieved 96.2\% and 97.4\% as it's training and validation accuracies respectively. For the further evaluation, proposed framework is tested on a custom dataset of 39 participants in various light circumstances and achieved 95.5\% accuracy. The conducted experimentations revealed the significant potential of our framework for practical applications in smart transportation systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Stopwords carry little semantic information and are often removed from text data to reduce dataset size and improve machine learning model performance. Consequently, researchers have sought to develop techniques for generating effective stopword sets. Previous approaches have ranged from qualitative techniques relying upon linguistic experts, to statistical approaches that extract word importance using correlations or frequency-dependent metrics computed on a corpus. We present a novel quantitative approach that employs iterative and recursive feature deletion algorithms to see which words can be deleted from a pre-trained transformer's vocabulary with the least degradation to its performance, specifically for the task of sentiment analysis. Empirically, stopword lists generated via this approach drastically reduce dataset size while negligibly impacting model performance, in one such example shrinking the corpus by 28.4% while improving the accuracy of a trained logistic regression model by 0.25%. In another instance, the corpus was shrunk by 63.7% with a 2.8% decrease in accuracy. These promising results indicate that our approach can generate highly effective stopword sets for specific NLP tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Masked visual modeling (MVM) has been recently proven effective for visual pre-training. While similar reconstructive objectives on video inputs (e.g., masked frame modeling) have been explored in video-language (VidL) pre-training, the pre-extracted video features in previous studies cannot be refined through MVM during pre-training, and thus leading to unsatisfactory downstream performance. In this work, we systematically examine the potential of MVM in the context of VidL learning. Specifically, we base our study on a fully end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET), which mitigates the disconnection between fixed video representations and MVM training. In total, eight different reconstructive targets of MVM are explored, from low-level pixel values and oriented gradients to high-level depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens and latent visual features. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide insights on the factors leading to effective MVM training. Empirically, we show VIOLET pre-trained with MVM objective achieves notable improvements on 13 VidL benchmarks, ranging from video question answering, video captioning, to text-to-video retrieval.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01559
 - **Abstract**
 Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based social networks, yet remains challenging due to a high degree of variation and personalization exhibited in user movements. In this work, we explore the latent hierarchical structure composed of multi-granularity short-term structural patterns in user check-in sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal context AggRegated Hierarchical Transformer (STAR-HiT) for next POI recommendation, which employs stacked hierarchical encoders to recursively encode the spatio-temporal context and explicitly locate subsequences of different granularities. More specifically, in each encoder, the global attention layer captures the spatio-temporal context of the sequence, while the local attention layer performed within each subsequence enhances subsequence modeling using the local context. The sequence partition layer infers positions and lengths of subsequences from the global context adaptively, such that semantics in subsequences can be well preserved. Finally, the subsequence aggregation layer fuses representations within each subsequence to form the corresponding subsequence representation, thereby generating a new sequence of higher-level granularity. The stacking of encoders captures the latent hierarchical structure of the check-in sequence, which is used to predict the next visiting POI. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance whilst providing explanations for recommendations. Codes are available at https://github.com/JennyXieJiayi/STAR-HiT.

 - **Abstract**
 Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multiple sequential video frames by a single measurement using the idea of computational imaging. The underlying principle is to modulate high-speed frames through different masks and these modulated frames are summed to a single measurement captured by a low-speed 2D sensor (dubbed optical encoder); following this, algorithms are employed to reconstruct the desired high-speed frames (dubbed software decoder) if needed. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction algorithm in video SCI, i.e., recovering a series of video frames from a compressed measurement. Specifically, we propose a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) to exploit the correlation in both spatial and temporal domains. STFormer network is composed of a token generation block, a video reconstruction block, and these two blocks are connected by a series of STFormer blocks. Each STFormer block consists of a spatial self-attention branch, a temporal self-attention branch and the outputs of these two branches are integrated by a fusion network. Extensive results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of STFormer. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ucaswangls/STFormer.git

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformer and its variants have demonstrated great potential in various computer vision tasks. But conventional vision transformers often focus on global dependency at a coarse level, which suffer from a learning challenge on global relationships and fine-grained representation at a token level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-scale Attention Fusion into transformer (MAFormer), which explores local aggregation and global feature extraction in a dual-stream framework for visual recognition. We develop a simple but effective module to explore the full potential of transformers for visual representation by learning fine-grained and coarse-grained features at a token level and dynamically fusing them. Our Multi-scale Attention Fusion (MAF) block consists of: i) a local window attention branch that learns short-range interactions within windows, aggregating fine-grained local features; ii) global feature extraction through a novel Global Learning with Down-sampling (GLD) operation to efficiently capture long-range context information within the whole image; iii) a fusion module that self-explores the integration of both features via attention. Our MAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on common vision tasks. In particular, MAFormer-L achieves 85.9$\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing CSWin-B and LV-ViT-L by 1.7$\%$ and 0.6$\%$ respectively. On MSCOCO, MAFormer outperforms the prior art CSWin by 1.7$\%$ mAPs on object detection and 1.4$\%$ on instance segmentation with similar-sized parameters, demonstrating the potential to be a general backbone network.

 - **Abstract**
 Sparse expert models are a thirty-year old concept re-emerging as a popular architecture in deep learning. This class of architecture encompasses Mixture-of-Experts, Switch Transformers, Routing Networks, BASE layers, and others, all with the unifying idea that each example is acted on by a subset of the parameters. By doing so, the degree of sparsity decouples the parameter count from the compute per example allowing for extremely large, but efficient models. The resulting models have demonstrated significant improvements across diverse domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. We review the concept of sparse expert models, provide a basic description of the common algorithms, contextualize the advances in the deep learning era, and conclude by highlighting areas for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 Some data from multiple sources can be modeled as multimodal time-series events which have different sampling frequencies, data compositions, temporal relations and characteristics. Different types of events have complex nonlinear relationships, and the time of each event is irregular. Neither the classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model nor the current state-of-the-art Transformer model can deal with these features well. In this paper, a features fusion framework for multimodal irregular time-series events is proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Firstly, the complex features are extracted according to the irregular patterns of different events. Secondly, the nonlinear correlation and complex temporal dependencies relationship between complex features are captured and fused into a tensor. Finally, a feature gate are used to control the access frequency of different tensors. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms to the existing methods in terms of AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AP (Average Precision).

 - **Abstract**
 Effectively preserving and encoding structure features from objects in irregular and sparse LiDAR points is a key challenge to 3D object detection on point cloud. Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on many 2D and even 3D vision tasks. Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution kernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the unrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial structure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a simple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and all the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic operation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local structure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose a Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local structure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the local structure. Compared to the self-attention mechanism in traditional Transformer, SEFormer learns different feature transformations for value points based on the relative directions and distances to the query point. Then we propose a SEFormer based network for high-performance 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve SOTA results on Waymo Open Dataset, the largest 3D detection benchmark for autonomous driving. Specifically, SEFormer achieves 79.02% mAP, which is 1.2% higher than existing works. We will release the codes.

 - **Abstract**
 While Transformers have had significant success in paragraph generation, they treat sentences as linear sequences of tokens and often neglect their hierarchical information. Prior work has shown that decomposing the levels of granularity~(e.g., word, phrase, or sentence) for input tokens has produced substantial improvements, suggesting the possibility of enhancing Transformers via more fine-grained modeling of granularity. In this work, we propose a continuous decomposition of granularity for neural paraphrase generation (C-DNPG). In order to efficiently incorporate granularity into sentence encoding, C-DNPG introduces a granularity-aware attention (GA-Attention) mechanism which extends the multi-head self-attention with: 1) a granularity head that automatically infers the hierarchical structure of a sentence by neurally estimating the granularity level of each input token; and 2) two novel attention masks, namely, granularity resonance and granularity scope, to efficiently encode granularity into attention. Experiments on two benchmarks, including Quora question pairs and Twitter URLs have shown that C-DNPG outperforms baseline models by a remarkable margin and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of many metrics. Qualitative analysis reveals that C-DNPG indeed captures fine-grained levels of granularity with effectiveness.

 - **Abstract**
 The deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based single image dehazing methods have achieved significant success. The previous methods are devoted to improving the network's performance by increasing the network's depth and width. The current methods focus on increasing the convolutional kernel size to enhance its performance by benefiting from the larger receptive field. However, directly increasing the size of the convolutional kernel introduces a massive amount of computational overhead and parameters. Thus, a novel Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Block (LKD Block) consisting of the Decomposition deep-wise Large Kernel Convolution Block (DLKCB) and the Channel Enhanced Feed-forward Network (CEFN) is devised in this paper. The designed DLKCB can split the deep-wise large kernel convolution into a smaller depth-wise convolution and a depth-wise dilated convolution without introducing massive parameters and computational overhead. Meanwhile, the designed CEFN incorporates a channel attention mechanism into Feed-forward Network to exploit significant channels and enhance robustness. By combining multiple LKD Blocks and Up-Down sampling modules, the Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Network (LKD-Net) is conducted. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed DLKCB and CEFN, and our LKD-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art. On the SOTS indoor dataset, our LKD-Net dramatically outperforms the Transformer-based method Dehamer with only 1.79% #Param and 48.9% FLOPs. The source code of our LKD-Net is available at https://github.com/SWU-CS-MediaLab/LKD-Net.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomaly detection with only prior knowledge from normal samples attracts more attention because of the lack of anomaly samples. Existing CNN-based pixel reconstruction approaches suffer from two concerns. First, the reconstruction source and target are raw pixel values that contain indistinguishable semantic information. Second, CNN tends to reconstruct both normal samples and anomalies well, making them still hard to distinguish. In this paper, we propose Anomaly Detection TRansformer (ADTR) to apply a transformer to reconstruct pre-trained features. The pre-trained features contain distinguishable semantic information. Also, the adoption of transformer limits to reconstruct anomalies well such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction fails. Moreover, we propose novel loss functions to make our approach compatible with the normal-sample-only case and the anomaly-available case with both image-level and pixel-level labeled anomalies. The performance could be further improved by adding simple synthetic or external irrelevant anomalies. Extensive experiments are conducted on anomaly detection datasets including MVTec-AD and CIFAR-10. Our method achieves superior performance compared with all baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in the development of large language models have resulted in public access to state-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs), including Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). However, evaluations of PLMs, in practice, have shown their susceptibility to adversarial attacks during the training and fine-tuning stages of development. Such attacks can result in erroneous outputs, model-generated hate speech, and the exposure of users' sensitive information. While existing research has focused on adversarial attacks during either the training or the fine-tuning of PLMs, there is a deficit of information on attacks made between these two development phases. In this work, we highlight a major security vulnerability in the public release of GPT-3 and further investigate this vulnerability in other state-of-the-art PLMs. We restrict our work to pre-trained models that have not undergone fine-tuning. Further, we underscore token distance-minimized perturbations as an effective adversarial approach, bypassing both supervised and unsupervised quality measures. Following this approach, we observe a significant decrease in text classification quality when evaluating for semantic similarity.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02174
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02174
 - **Abstract**
 The key to shadow removal is recovering the contents of the shadow regions with the guidance of the non-shadow regions. Due to the inadequate long-range modeling, the CNN-based approaches cannot thoroughly investigate the information from the non-shadow regions. To solve this problem, we propose a novel cleanness-navigated-shadow network (CNSNet), with a shadow-oriented adaptive normalization (SOAN) module and a shadow-aware aggregation with transformer (SAAT) module based on the shadow mask. Under the guidance of the shadow mask, the SOAN module formulates the statistics from the non-shadow region and adaptively applies them to the shadow region for region-wise restoration. The SAAT module utilizes the shadow mask to precisely guide the restoration of each shadowed pixel by considering the highly relevant pixels from the shadow-free regions for global pixel-wise restoration. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD) show that our method achieves superior de-shadowing performance.

 - **Abstract**
 The popular methods for semi-supervised semantic segmentation mostly adopt a unitary network model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and enforce consistency of the model predictions over small perturbations applied to the inputs or model. However, such a learning paradigm suffers from a) limited learning capability of the CNN-based model; b) limited capacity of learning the discriminative features for the unlabeled data; c) limited learning for both global and local information from the whole image. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Learning approach, called Transformer-CNN Cohort (TCC), that consists of two students with one based on the vision transformer (ViT) and the other based on the CNN. Our method subtly incorporates the multi-level consistency regularization on the predictions and the heterogeneous feature spaces via pseudo labeling for the unlabeled data. First, as the inputs of the ViT student are image patches, the feature maps extracted encode crucial class-wise statistics. To this end, we propose class-aware feature consistency distillation (CFCD) that first leverages the outputs of each student as the pseudo labels and generates class-aware feature (CF) maps. It then transfers knowledge via the CF maps between the students. Second, as the ViT student has more uniform representations for all layers, we propose consistency-aware cross distillation to transfer knowledge between the pixel-wise predictions from the cohort. We validate the TCC framework on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets, which significantly outperforms existing semi-supervised methods by a large margin.

 - **Abstract**
 Light field (LF) images with the multi-view property have many applications, which can be severely affected by the low-light imaging. Recent learning-based methods for low-light enhancement have their own disadvantages, such as no noise suppression, complex training process and poor performance in extremely low-light conditions. Targeted on solving these deficiencies while fully utilizing the multi-view information, we propose an efficient Low-light Restoration Transformer (LRT) for LF images, with multiple heads to perform specific intermediate tasks, including denoising, luminance adjustment, refinement and detail enhancement, within a single network, achieving progressive restoration from small scale to full scale. We design an angular transformer block with a view-token scheme to model the global angular relationship efficiently, and a multi-scale window-based transformer block to encode the multi-scale local and global spatial information. To solve the problem of insufficient training data, we formulate a synthesis pipeline by simulating the major noise with the estimated noise parameters of LF camera. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance on the restoration of extremely low-light and noisy LF images with high efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Reference resolution, which aims to identify entities being referred to by a speaker, is more complex in real world settings: new referents may be created by processes the agents engage in and/or be salient only because they belong to the shared physical setting. Our focus is on resolving references to visualizations on a large screen display in multimodal dialogue; crucially, reference resolution is directly involved in the process of creating new visualizations. We describe our annotations for user references to visualizations appearing on a large screen via language and hand gesture and also new entity establishment, which results from executing the user request to create a new visualization. We also describe our reference resolution pipeline which relies on an information-state architecture to maintain dialogue context. We report results on detecting and resolving references, effectiveness of contextual information on the model, and under-specified requests for creating visualizations. We also experiment with conventional CRF and deep learning / transformer models (BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CRF) for tagging references in user utterance text. Our results show that transfer learning significantly boost performance of the deep learning methods, although CRF still out-performs them, suggesting that conventional methods may generalize better for low resource data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent years have witnessed a trend of applying context frames to boost the performance of object detection as video object detection. Existing methods usually aggregate features at one stroke to enhance the feature. These methods, however, usually lack spatial information from neighboring frames and suffer from insufficient feature aggregation. To address the issues, we perform a progressive way to introduce both temporal information and spatial information for an integrated enhancement. The temporal information is introduced by the temporal feature aggregation model (TFAM), by conducting an attention mechanism between the context frames and the target frame (i.e., the frame to be detected). Meanwhile, we employ a Spatial Transition Awareness Model (STAM) to convey the location transition information between each context frame and target frame. Built upon a transformer-based detector DETR, our PTSEFormer also follows an end-to-end fashion to avoid heavy post-processing procedures while achieving 88.1% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hon-Wong/PTSEFormer.

 - **Abstract**
 Large transformer models display promising performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Although the AI community has expanded the model scale to the trillion parameter level, the practical deployment of 10-100 billion parameter models is still uncertain due to the latency, throughput, and memory constraints. In this paper, we proposed EnergonAI to solve the challenges of the efficient deployment of 10-100 billion parameter transformer models on single- or multi-GPU systems. EnergonAI adopts a hierarchy-controller system architecture to coordinate multiple devices and efficiently support different parallel patterns. It delegates the execution of sub-models to multiple workers in the single-controller style and applies tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism among the workers in a multi-controller style. Upon the novel architecture, we propose three techniques, i.e. non-blocking pipeline parallelism, distributed redundant computation elimination, and peer memory pooling. EnergonAI enables the users to program complex parallel code the same as a serial one. Compared with the FasterTransformer, we have proven that EnergonAI has superior performance on latency and throughput. In our experiments, EnergonAI can achieve 37% latency reduction in tensor parallelism, 10% scalability improvement in pipeline parallelism, and it improves the model scale inferred on a single GPU by using a larger heterogeneous memory space at cost of limited performance reduction.

 - **Abstract**
 Fully supervised skeleton-based action recognition has achieved great progress with the blooming of deep learning techniques. However, these methods require sufficient labeled data which is not easy to obtain. In contrast, self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition has attracted more attention. With utilizing the unlabeled data, more generalizable features can be learned to alleviate the overfitting problem and reduce the demand of massive labeled training data. Inspired by the MAE, we propose a spatial-temporal masked autoencoder framework for self-supervised 3D skeleton-based action recognition (SkeletonMAE). Following MAE's masking and reconstruction pipeline, we utilize a skeleton based encoder-decoder transformer architecture to reconstruct the masked skeleton sequences. A novel masking strategy, named Spatial-Temporal Masking, is introduced in terms of both joint-level and frame-level for the skeleton sequence. This pre-training strategy makes the encoder output generalizable skeleton features with spatial and temporal dependencies. Given the unmasked skeleton sequence, the encoder is fine-tuned for the action recognition task.

 - **Abstract**
 Human pose estimation aims to figure out the keypoints of all people in different scenes. Current approaches still face some challenges despite promising results. Existing top-down methods deal with a single person individually, without the interaction between different people and the scene they are situated in. Consequently, the performance of human detection degrades when serious occlusion happens. On the other hand, existing bottom-up methods consider all people at the same time and capture the global knowledge of the entire image. However, they are less accurate than the top-down methods due to the scale variation. To address these problems, we propose a novel Dual-Pipeline Integrated Transformer (DPIT) by integrating top-down and bottom-up pipelines to explore the visual clues of different receptive fields and achieve their complementarity. Specifically, DPIT consists of two branches, the bottom-up branch deals with the whole image to capture the global visual information, while the top-down branch extracts the feature representation of local vision from the single-human bounding box. Then, the extracted feature representations from bottom-up and top-down branches are fed into the transformer encoder to fuse the global and local knowledge interactively. Moreover, we define the keypoint queries to explore both full-scene and single-human posture visual clues to realize the mutual complementarity of the two pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to integrate the bottom-up and top-down pipelines with transformers for human pose estimation. Extensive experiments on COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our DPIT achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge Distillation (KD) for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is extensively studied as a way to boost the performance of a small model. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved great success on many computer vision tasks and KD for ViT is also desired. However, besides the output logit-based KD, other feature-based KD methods for CNNs cannot be directly applied to ViT due to the huge structure gap. In this paper, we explore the way of feature-based distillation for ViT. Based on the nature of feature maps in ViT, we design a series of controlled experiments and derive three practical guidelines for ViT's feature distillation. Some of our findings are even opposite to the practices in the CNN era. Based on the three guidelines, we propose our feature-based method ViTKD which brings consistent and considerable improvement to the student. On ImageNet-1k, we boost DeiT-Tiny from 74.42% to 76.06%, DeiT-Small from 80.55% to 81.95%, and DeiT-Base from 81.76% to 83.46%. Moreover, ViTKD and the logit-based KD method are complementary and can be applied together directly. This combination can further improve the performance of the student. Specifically, the student DeiT-Tiny, Small, and Base achieve 77.78%, 83.59%, and 85.41%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/yzd-v/cls_KD.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding Transformer-based models has attracted significant attention, as they lie at the heart of recent technological advances across machine learning. While most interpretability methods rely on running models over inputs, recent work has shown that a zero-pass approach, where parameters are interpreted directly without a forward/backward pass is feasible for some Transformer parameters, and for two-layer attention networks. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis where all parameters of a trained Transformer are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space, that is, the space of vocabulary items they operate on. We derive a simple theoretical framework to support our arguments and provide ample evidence for its validity. First, an empirical analysis showing that parameters of both pretrained and fine-tuned models can be interpreted in embedding space. Second, we present two applications of our framework: (a) aligning the parameters of different models that share a vocabulary, and (b) constructing a classifier without training by ``translating'' the parameters of a fine-tuned classifier to parameters of a different model that was only pretrained. Overall, our findings open the door to interpretation methods that, at least in part, abstract away from model specifics and operate in the embedding space only.

 - **Abstract**
 Semantic image synthesis enables control over unconditional image generation by allowing guidance on what is being generated. We conditionally synthesize the latent space from a vector quantized model (VQ-model) pre-trained to autoencode images. Instead of training an autoregressive Transformer on separately learned conditioning latents and image latents, we find that jointly learning the conditioning and image latents significantly improves the modeling capabilities of the Transformer model. While our jointly trained VQ-model achieves a similar reconstruction performance to a vanilla VQ-model for both semantic and image latents, tying the two modalities at the autoencoding stage proves to be an important ingredient to improve autoregressive modeling performance. We show that our model improves semantic image synthesis using autoregressive models on popular semantic image datasets ADE20k, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff.

 The scientific outcomes of the 2022 Landslide4Sense (L4S) competition organized by the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI) are presented here. The objective of the competition is to automatically detect landslides based on large-scale multiple sources of satellite imagery collected globally. The 2022 L4S aims to foster interdisciplinary research on recent developments in deep learning (DL) models for the semantic segmentation task using satellite imagery. In the past few years, DL-based models have achieved performance that meets expectations on image interpretation, due to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main objective of this article is to present the details and the best-performing algorithms featured in this competition. The winning solutions are elaborated with state-of-the-art models like the Swin Transformer, SegFormer, and U-Net. Advanced machine learning techniques and strategies such as hard example mining, self-training, and mix-up data augmentation are also considered. Moreover, we describe the L4S benchmark data set in order to facilitate further comparisons, and report the results of the accuracy assessment online. The data is accessible on \textit{Future Development Leaderboard} for future evaluation at \url{https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense/challenge/}, and researchers are invited to submit more prediction results, evaluate the accuracy of their methods, compare them with those of other users, and, ideally, improve the landslide detection results reported in this article.

 - **Abstract**
 Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in \cite{Cho2021} for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.

 - **Abstract**
 When developing autonomous driving systems (ADS), developers often need to replay previously collected driving recordings to check the correctness of newly introduced changes to the system. However, simply replaying the entire recording is not necessary given the high redundancy of driving scenes in a recording (e.g., keeping the same lane for 10 minutes on a highway). In this paper, we propose a novel test reduction and prioritization approach for multi-module ADS. First, our approach automatically encodes frames in a driving recording to feature vectors based on a driving scene schema. Then, the given recording is sliced into segments based on the similarity of consecutive vectors. Lengthy segments are truncated to reduce the length of a recording and redundant segments with the same vector are removed. The remaining segments are prioritized based on both the coverage and the rarity of driving scenes. We implemented this approach on an industry level, multi-module ADS called Apollo and evaluated it on three road maps in various regression settings. The results show that our approach significantly reduced the original recordings by over 34% while keeping comparable test effectiveness, identifying almost all injected faults. Furthermore, our test prioritization method achieves about 22% to 39% and 41% to 53% improvements over three baselines in terms of both the average percentage of faults detected (APFD) and TOP-K.

 - **Abstract**
 As Autonomous Vehicle (AV) development has progressed, concerns regarding the safety of passengers and agents in their environment have risen. Each real world traffic collision involving autonomously controlled vehicles has compounded this concern. Open source autonomous driving implementations show a software architecture with complex interdependent tasks, heavily reliant on machine learning and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are vulnerable to non deterministic faults and corner cases. These complex subsystems work together to fulfill the mission of the AV while also maintaining safety. Although significant improvements are being made towards increasing the empirical reliability and confidence in these systems, the inherent limitations of DNN verification create an, as yet, insurmountable challenge in providing deterministic safety guarantees in AV. We propose Synergistic Redundancy (SR), a safety architecture for complex cyber physical systems, like AV. SR provides verifiable safety guarantees against specific faults by decoupling the mission and safety tasks of the system. Simultaneous to independently fulfilling their primary roles, the partially functionally redundant mission and safety tasks are able to aid each other, synergistically improving the combined system. The synergistic safety layer uses only verifiable and logically analyzable software to fulfill its tasks. Close coordination with the mission layer allows easier and early detection of safety critical faults in the system. SR simplifies the mission layer's optimization goals and improves its design. SR provides safe deployment of high performance, although inherently unverifiable, machine learning software. In this work, we first present the design and features of the SR architecture and then evaluate the efficacy of the solution, focusing on the crucial problem of obstacle existence detection faults in AV.

 - **Abstract**
 Effectively preserving and encoding structure features from objects in irregular and sparse LiDAR points is a key challenge to 3D object detection on point cloud. Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on many 2D and even 3D vision tasks. Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution kernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the unrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial structure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a simple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and all the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic operation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local structure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose a Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local structure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the local structure. Compared to the self-attention mechanism in traditional Transformer, SEFormer learns different feature transformations for value points based on the relative directions and distances to the query point. Then we propose a SEFormer based network for high-performance 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve SOTA results on Waymo Open Dataset, the largest 3D detection benchmark for autonomous driving. Specifically, SEFormer achieves 79.02% mAP, which is 1.2% higher than existing works. We will release the codes.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving decision-making is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty in traffic. For example, adjacent vehicles may change their lane or overtake at any time to pass a slow vehicle or to help traffic flow. Anticipating the intention of surrounding vehicles, estimating their future states and integrating them into the decision-making process of an automated vehicle can enhance the reliability of autonomous driving in complex driving scenarios. This paper proposes a Prediction-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDRL) decision-making model that considers the manoeuvre intentions of surrounding vehicles in the decision-making process for highway driving. The model is trained using real traffic data and tested in various traffic conditions through a simulation platform. The results show that the proposed PDRL model improves the decision-making performance compared to a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model by decreasing collision numbers, resulting in safer driving.

 - **Abstract**
 Training multiple agents to perform safe and cooperative control in the complex scenarios of autonomous driving has been a challenge. For a small fleet of cars moving together, this paper proposes Lepus, a new approach to training multiple agents. Lepus adopts a pure cooperative manner for training multiple agents, featured with the shared parameters of policy networks and the shared reward function of multiple agents. In particular, Lepus pre-trains the policy networks via an adversarial process, improving its collaborative decision-making capability and further the stability of car driving. Moreover, for alleviating the problem of sparse rewards, Lepus learns an approximate reward function from expert trajectories by combining a random network and a distillation network. We conduct extensive experiments on the MADRaS simulation platform. The experimental results show that multiple agents trained by Lepus can avoid collisions as many as possible while driving simultaneously and outperform the other four methods, that is, DDPG-FDE, PSDDPG, MADDPG, and MAGAIL(DDPG) in terms of stability.

 - **Abstract**
 Intersection is one of the most challenging scenarios for autonomous driving tasks. Due to the complexity and stochasticity, essential applications (e.g., behavior modeling, motion prediction, safety validation, etc.) at intersections rely heavily on data-driven techniques. Thus, there is an intense demand for trajectory datasets of traffic participants (TPs) in intersections. Currently, most intersections in urban areas are equipped with traffic lights. However, there is not yet a large-scale, high-quality, publicly available trajectory dataset for signalized intersections. Therefore, in this paper, a typical two-phase signalized intersection is selected in Tianjin, China. Besides, a pipeline is designed to construct a Signalized INtersection Dataset (SIND), which contains 7 hours of recording including over 13,000 TPs with 7 types. Then, the behaviors of traffic light violations in SIND are recorded. Furthermore, the SIND is also compared with other similar works. The features of the SIND can be summarized as follows: 1) SIND provides more comprehensive information, including traffic light states, motion parameters, High Definition (HD) map, etc. 2) The category of TPs is diverse and characteristic, where the proportion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) is up to 62.6% 3) Multiple traffic light violations of non-motor vehicles are shown. We believe that SIND would be an effective supplement to existing datasets and can promote related research on autonomous driving.The dataset is available online via: https://github.com/SOTIF-AVLab/SinD

 - **Abstract**
 3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) ensures consistency during continuous dynamic detection, conducive to subsequent motion planning and navigation tasks in autonomous driving. However, camera-based methods suffer in the case of occlusions and it can be challenging to accurately track the irregular motion of objects for LiDAR-based methods. Some fusion methods work well but do not consider the untrustworthy issue of appearance features under occlusion. At the same time, the false detection problem also significantly affects tracking. As such, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion 3D MOT framework based on the Combined Appearance-Motion Optimization (CAMO-MOT), which uses both camera and LiDAR data and significantly reduces tracking failures caused by occlusion and false detection. For occlusion problems, we are the first to propose an occlusion head to select the best object appearance features multiple times effectively, reducing the influence of occlusions. To decrease the impact of false detection in tracking, we design a motion cost matrix based on confidence scores which improve the positioning and object prediction accuracy in 3D space. As existing multi-object tracking methods only consider a single category, we also propose to build a multi-category loss to implement multi-object tracking in multi-category scenes. A series of validation experiments are conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes tracking benchmarks. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the lowest identity switches (IDS) value (23 for Car and 137 for Pedestrian) among all multi-modal MOT methods on the KITTI test dataset. And our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among all algorithms on the nuScenes test dataset with 75.3% AMOTA.
