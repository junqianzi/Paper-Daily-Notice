 - **Abstract**
 Visual perception plays an important role in autonomous driving. One of the primary tasks is object detection and identification. Since the vision sensor is rich in color and texture information, it can quickly and accurately identify various road information. The commonly used technique is based on extracting and calculating various features of the image. The recent development of deep learning-based method has better reliability and processing speed and has a greater advantage in recognizing complex elements. For depth estimation, vision sensor is also used for ranging due to their small size and low cost. Monocular camera uses image data from a single viewpoint as input to estimate object depth. In contrast, stereo vision is based on parallax and matching feature points of different views, and the application of deep learning also further improves the accuracy. In addition, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) can establish a model of the road environment, thus helping the vehicle perceive the surrounding environment and complete the tasks. In this paper, we introduce and compare various methods of object detection and identification, then explain the development of depth estimation and compare various methods based on monocular, stereo, and RDBG sensors, next review and compare various methods of SLAM, and finally summarize the current problems and present the future development trends of vision technologies.

 This article presents a novel review of Active SLAM (A-SLAM) research conducted in the last decade. We discuss the formulation, application, and methodology applied in A-SLAM for trajectory generation and control action selection using information theory based approaches. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis highlights the approaches, scenarios, configurations, types of robots, sensor types, dataset usage, and path planning approaches of A-SLAM research. We conclude by presenting the limitations and proposing future research possibilities. We believe that this survey will be helpful to researchers in understanding the various methods and techniques applied to A-SLAM formulation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present an evolved version of the Situational Graphs, which jointly models in a single optimizable factor graph, a SLAM graph, as a set of robot keyframes, containing its associated measurements and robot poses, and a 3D scene graph, as a high-level representation of the environment that encodes its different geometric elements with semantic attributes and the relational information between those elements. Our proposed S-Graphs+ is a novel four-layered factor graph that includes: (1) a keyframes layer with robot pose estimates, (2) a walls layer representing wall surfaces, (3) a rooms layer encompassing sets of wall planes, and (4) a floors layer gathering the rooms within a given floor level. The above graph is optimized in real-time to obtain a robust and accurate estimate of the robot's pose and its map, simultaneously constructing and leveraging the high-level information of the environment. To extract such high-level information, we present novel room and floor segmentation algorithms utilizing the mapped wall planes and free-space clusters. We tested S-Graphs+ on multiple datasets including, simulations of distinct indoor environments, on real datasets captured over several construction sites and office environments, and on a real public dataset of indoor office environments. S-Graphs+ outperforms relevant baselines in the majority of the datasets while extending the robot situational awareness by a four-layered scene model. Moreover, we make the algorithm available as a docker file.

 - **Abstract**
 As one of the most popular micro-mobility options, e-scooters are spreading in hundreds of big cities and college towns in the US and worldwide. In the meantime, e-scooters are also posing new challenges to traffic safety. In general, e-scooters are suggested to be ridden in bike lanes/sidewalks or share the road with cars at the maximum speed of about 15-20 mph, which is more flexible and much faster than the pedestrains and bicyclists. These features make e-scooters challenging for human drivers, pedestrians, vehicle active safety modules, and self-driving modules to see and interact. To study this new mobility option and address e-scooter riders' and other road users' safety concerns, this paper proposes a wearable data collection system for investigating the micro-level e-Scooter motion behavior in a Naturalistic road environment. An e-Scooter-based data acquisition system has been developed by integrating LiDAR, cameras, and GPS using the robot operating system (ROS). Software frameworks are developed to support hardware interfaces, sensor operation, sensor synchronization, and data saving. The integrated system can collect data continuously for hours, meeting all the requirements including calibration accuracy and capability of collecting the vehicle and e-Scooter encountering data.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are emerging as a ubiquitous scene representation that allows for novel view synthesis. Increasingly, NeRFs will be shareable with other people. Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be desirable to remove personal information or unsightly objects. Such removal is not easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view coherent manner. We validate our approach using a new and still-challenging dataset for the task of NeRF inpainting.

 - **Abstract**
 In the pulp and paper industry, about 5 Mt/y chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) are produced globally from softwood chips for production of carton board grades. For tailor making CTMP for this purpose, wood chips are impregnated with aqueous sodium sulphite for sulphonation of the wood lignin. When lignin is sulphonated, the defibration of wood into pulp becomes more selective, resulting in enhanced pulp properties. On a microscopic fibre scale, however, one could strongly assume that the sulphonation of the wood structure is very uneven due to its macroscale size of wood chips. If this is the case and the sulphonation could be done significantly more evenly, the CTMP process could be more efficient and produce pulp even better suited for carton boards. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a technique based on X-ray fluorescence microscopy imaging (uXRF) for quantifying the sulphur distribution on CTMP wood fibres. The feasibility of uXRF imaging for sulphur homogeneity measurements in wood fibres needs investigation. Clarification of which spatial and spectral resolution that allows visualization of sulphur impregnation into single wood fibres is needed. Measurements of single fibre imaging were carried out at the APS synchrotron facility. With a synchrotron beam using 1 um scanning step, images of elemental mapping are acquired from CTMP samples diluted with non-sulphonated pulp under specified conditions. Since the measurements show significant differ-ences between sulphonated and non-sulphonated fibres, and a significant peak concentration in the shell of the sulphonated fibres, the proposed technique is found to be feasible. The required spatial resolution of the uXRF imaging for an on-site CTMP sulphur homogeneity measurement setup is about 15 um, and the homogeneity measured along the fibre shells is suggested to be used as the CTMP sulphonation measurement parameter.

### SALVE: Self-supervised Adaptive Low-light Video Enhancement

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11484
 - **Abstract**
 A self-supervised adaptive low-light video enhancement (SALVE) method is proposed in this work. SALVE first conducts an effective Retinex-based low-light image enhancement on a few key frames of an input low-light video. Next, it learns mappings from the low- to enhanced-light frames via Ridge regression. Finally, it uses these mappings to enhance the remaining frames in the input video. SALVE is a hybrid method that combines components from a traditional Retinex-based image enhancement method and a learning-based method. The former component leads to a robust solution which is easily adaptive to new real-world environments. The latter component offers a fast, computationally inexpensive and temporally consistent solution. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superior performance of SALVE. Our user study shows that 87% of participants prefer SALVE over prior work.

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping high-fidelity 3D geometry to a representation that allows for intuitive edits remains an elusive goal in computer vision and graphics. The key challenge is the need to model both continuous and discrete shape variations. Current approaches, such as implicit shape representation, lack straightforward interpretable encoding, while others that employ procedural methods output coarse geometry. We present GeoCode, a technique for 3D shape synthesis using an intuitively editable parameter space. We build a novel program that enforces a complex set of rules and enables users to perform intuitive and controlled high-level edits that procedurally propagate at a low level to the entire shape. Our program produces high-quality mesh outputs by construction. We use a neural network to map a given point cloud or sketch to our interpretable parameter space. Once produced by our procedural program, shapes can be easily modified. Empirically, we show that GeoCode can infer and recover 3D shapes more accurately compared to existing techniques and we demonstrate its ability to perform controlled local and global shape manipulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Today, software systems have a significant role in various domains among which are healthcare, entertainment, transport and logistics, and many more. It is only natural that with this increasing dependency on software, the number of software systems increases. Additionally, these systems become more and more complex. All this leads to a rise in the number of software faults also known as bugs. As a result, the ability to locate the source of a bug (e.g. a file or a commit) is vital for the development and maintenance of efficient software solutions. Bug localization refers to the automated process of discovering files that contain bugs, based on a bug report. This research project aims to make a literature review on different techniques for bug localization. This study distinguishes itself from other surveys and literature reviews [1] in one significant way. The focus of the work is on identifying, categorizing and analyzing existing bug localization methods and tools which were evaluated in an industrial setting. To the best of my knowledge, there are no other works that prioritise this aspect. Unfortunately, such literature is scarce, therefore, bug localization techniques evaluated on open source software are also included.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.

 - **Abstract**
 3D object detection is vital as it would enable us to capture objects' sizes, orientation, and position in the world. As a result, we would be able to use this 3D detection in real-world applications such as Augmented Reality (AR), self-driving cars, and robotics which perceive the world the same way we do as humans. Monocular 3D Object Detection is the task to draw 3D bounding box around objects in a single 2D RGB image. It is localization task but without any extra information like depth or other sensors or multiple images. Monocular 3D object detection is an important yet challenging task. Beyond the significant progress in image-based 2D object detection, 3D understanding of real-world objects is an open challenge that has not been explored extensively thus far. In addition to the most closely related studies.

 - **Abstract**
 This work introduces a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for the solution of parameterized second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations formulated on unfitted geometries. The goal is to construct efficient projection-based ROMs, which rely on techniques such as the reduced basis method and discrete empirical interpolation. The presence of geometrical parameters in unfitted domain discretizations entails challenges for the application of standard ROMs. Therefore, in this work we propose a methodology based on i) extension of snapshots on the background mesh and ii) localization strategies to decrease the number of reduced basis functions. The method we obtain is computationally efficient and accurate, while it is agnostic with respect to the underlying discretization choice. We test the applicability of the proposed framework with numerical experiments on two model problems, namely the Poisson and linear elasticity problems. In particular, we study several benchmarks formulated on two-dimensional, trimmed domains discretized with splines and we observe a significant reduction of the online computational cost compared to standard ROMs for the same level of accuracy. Moreover, we show the applicability of our methodology to a three-dimensional geometry of a linear elastic problem.

### Automatic Emotion Modelling in Written Stories

 - **Abstract**
 Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modelling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no labelled benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal annotations for an existing dataset of children's stories annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the originally categorical labels to the valence and arousal space. Leveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing, we propose a set of novel Transformer-based methods for predicting valence and arousal signals over the course of written stories. We explore several strategies for fine-tuning a pretrained ELECTRA model and study the benefits of considering a sentence's context when inferring its emotionality. Moreover, we experiment with additional LSTM and Transformer layers. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of .7338 for valence and .6302 for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the suitability of our proposed approach. Our code and additional annotations are made available at https://github.com/lc0197/emotion_modelling_stories.

 - **Abstract**
 Automated Program Repair (APR) is defined as the process of fixing a bug/defect in the source code, by an automated tool. APR tools have recently experienced promising results by leveraging state-of-the-art Neural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. APR tools such as TFix and CodeXGLUE combine text-to-text transformers with software-specific techniques are outperforming alternatives, these days. However, in most APR studies the train and test sets are chosen from the same set of projects. In reality, however, APR models are meant to be generalizable to new and different projects. Therefore, there is a potential threat that reported APR models with high effectiveness perform poorly when the characteristics of the new project or its bugs are different than the training set's(Domain Shift). In this study, we first define and measure the domain shift problem in automated program repair. Then, we then propose a domain adaptation framework that can adapt an APR model for a given target project. We conduct an empirical study with three domain adaptation methods FullFineTuning, TuningWithLightWeightAdapterLayers, and CurriculumLearning using two state-of-the-art domain adaptation tools (TFix and CodeXGLUE) and two APR models on 611 bugs from 19 projects. The results show that our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of TFix by 13.05% and CodeXGLUE by 23.4%. Another contribution of this study is the proposal of a data synthesis method to address the lack of labelled data in APR. We leverage transformers to create a bug generator model. We use the generated synthetic data to domain adapt TFix and CodeXGLUE on the projects with no data (Zero-shot learning), which results in an average improvement of 5.76% and 24.42% for TFix and CodeXGLUE, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Color is a critical design factor for web pages, affecting important factors such as viewer emotions and the overall trust and satisfaction of a website. Effective coloring requires design knowledge and expertise, but if this process could be automated through data-driven modeling, efficient exploration and alternative workflows would be possible. However, this direction remains underexplored due to the lack of a formalization of the web page colorization problem, datasets, and evaluation protocols. In this work, we propose a new dataset consisting of e-commerce mobile web pages in a tractable format, which are created by simplifying the pages and extracting canonical color styles with a common web browser. The web page colorization problem is then formalized as a task of estimating plausible color styles for a given web page content with a given hierarchical structure of the elements. We present several Transformer-based methods that are adapted to this task by prepending structural message passing to capture hierarchical relationships between elements. Experimental results, including a quantitative evaluation designed for this task, demonstrate the advantages of our methods over statistical and image colorization methods. The code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/webcolor.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11548
 - **Abstract**
 As the quality of optical sensors improves, there is a need for processing large-scale images. In particular, the ability of devices to capture ultra-high definition (UHD) images and video places new demands on the image processing pipeline. In this paper, we consider the task of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and introduce a large-scale database consisting of images at 4K and 8K resolution. We conduct systematic benchmarking studies and provide a comparison of current LLIE algorithms. As a second contribution, we introduce LLFormer, a transformer-based low-light enhancement method. The core components of LLFormer are the axis-based multi-head self-attention and cross-layer attention fusion block, which significantly reduces the linear complexity. Extensive experiments on the new dataset and existing public datasets show that LLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that employing existing LLIE methods trained on our benchmark as a pre-processing step significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks, e.g., face detection in low-light conditions. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/LLFormer.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11613
 - **Abstract**
 Automatic image colorization is a particularly challenging problem. Due to the high illness of the problem and multi-modal uncertainty, directly training a deep neural network usually leads to incorrect semantic colors and low color richness. Existing transformer-based methods can deliver better results but highly depend on hand-crafted dataset-level empirical distribution priors. In this work, we propose DDColor, a new end-to-end method with dual decoders, for image colorization. More specifically, we design a multi-scale image decoder and a transformer-based color decoder. The former manages to restore the spatial resolution of the image, while the latter establishes the correlation between semantic representations and color queries via cross-attention. The two decoders incorporate to learn semantic-aware color embedding by leveraging the multi-scale visual features. With the help of these two decoders, our method succeeds in producing semantically consistent and visually plausible colorization results without any additional priors. In addition, a simple but effective colorfulness loss is introduced to further improve the color richness of generated results. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDColor achieves significantly superior performance to existing state-of-the-art works both quantitatively and qualitatively. Codes will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regularly used for deep ocean applications. Commonly, the autonomous navigation task is carried out by a fusion between two sensors: the inertial navigation system and the Doppler velocity log (DVL). The DVL operates by transmitting four acoustic beams to the sea floor, and once reflected back, the AUV velocity vector can be estimated. However, in real-life scenarios, such as an uneven seabed, sea creatures blocking the DVL's view and, roll/pitch maneuvers, the acoustic beams' reflection is resulting in a scenario known as DVL outage. Consequently, a velocity update is not available to bind the inertial solution drift. To cope with such situations, in this paper, we leverage our BeamsNet framework and propose a Set-Transformer-based BeamsNet (ST-BeamsNet) that utilizes inertial data readings and previous DVL velocity measurements to regress the current AUV velocity in case of a complete DVL outage. The proposed approach was evaluated using data from experiments held in the Mediterranean Sea with the Snapir AUV and was compared to a moving average (MA) estimator. Our ST-BeamsNet estimated the AUV velocity vector with an 8.547% speed error, which is 26% better than the MA approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer-based models have been widely demonstrated to be successful in computer vision tasks by modelling long-range dependencies and capturing global representations. However, they are often dominated by features of large patterns leading to the loss of local details (e.g., boundaries and small objects), which are critical in medical image segmentation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Dual-Aggregation Transformer Network called DuAT, which is characterized by two innovative designs, namely, the Global-to-Local Spatial Aggregation (GLSA) and Selective Boundary Aggregation (SBA) modules. The GLSA has the ability to aggregate and represent both global and local spatial features, which are beneficial for locating large and small objects, respectively. The SBA module is used to aggregate the boundary characteristic from low-level features and semantic information from high-level features for better preserving boundary details and locating the re-calibration objects. Extensive experiments in six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the segmentation of skin lesion images, and polyps in colonoscopy images. In addition, our approach is more robust than existing methods in various challenging situations such as small object segmentation and ambiguous object boundaries.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11685
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a large-scale language pre-training for text GENeration using dIffusion modEl, which is named GENIE. GENIE is a pre-training sequence-to-sequence text generation model which combines Transformer and diffusion. The diffusion model accepts the latent information from the encoder, which is used to guide the denoising of the current time step. After multiple such denoise iterations, the diffusion model can restore the Gaussian noise to the diverse output text which is controlled by the input text. Moreover, such architecture design also allows us to adopt large scale pre-training on the GENIE. We propose a novel pre-training method named continuous paragraph denoise based on the characteristics of the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Gigaword benchmarks shows that GENIE can achieves comparable performance with various strong baselines, especially after pre-training, the generation quality of GENIE is greatly improved.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new neural network design paradigm Reversible Column Network (RevCol). The main body of RevCol is composed of multiple copies of subnetworks, named columns respectively, between which multi-level reversible connections are employed. Such architectural scheme attributes RevCol very different behavior from conventional networks: during forward propagation, features in RevCol are learned to be gradually disentangled when passing through each column, whose total information is maintained rather than compressed or discarded as other network does. Our experiments suggest that CNN-style RevCol models can achieve very competitive performances on multiple computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, especially with large parameter budget and large dataset. For example, after ImageNet-22K pre-training, RevCol-XL obtains 88.2% ImageNet-1K accuracy. Given more pre-training data, our largest model RevCol-H reaches 90.0% on ImageNet-1K, 63.8% APbox on COCO detection minival set, 61.0% mIoU on ADE20k segmentation. To our knowledge, it is the best COCO detection and ADE20k segmentation result among pure (static) CNN models. Moreover, as a general macro architecture fashion, RevCol can also be introduced into transformers or other neural networks, which is demonstrated to improve the performances in both computer vision and NLP tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Heuristic search algorithms, e.g. A*, are the commonly used tools for pathfinding on grids, i.e. graphs of regular structure that are widely employed to represent environments in robotics, video games etc. Instance-independent heuristics for grid graphs, e.g. Manhattan distance, do not take the obstacles into account and, thus, the search led by such heuristics performs poorly in the obstacle-rich environments. To this end, we suggest learning the instance-dependent heuristic proxies that are supposed to notably increase the efficiency of the search. The first heuristic proxy we suggest to learn is the correction factor, i.e. the ratio between the instance independent cost-to-go estimate and the perfect one (computed offline at the training phase). Unlike learning the absolute values of the cost-to-go heuristic function, which was known before, when learning the correction factor the knowledge of the instance-independent heuristic is utilized. The second heuristic proxy is the path probability, which indicates how likely the grid cell is lying on the shortest path. This heuristic can be utilized in the Focal Search framework as the secondary heuristic, allowing us to preserve the guarantees on the bounded sub-optimality of the solution. We learn both suggested heuristics in a supervised fashion with the state-of-the-art neural networks containing attention blocks (transformers). We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on a comprehensive dataset of planning tasks, showing that the suggested techniques i) reduce the computational effort of the A* up to a factor of $4$x while producing the solutions, which costs exceed the costs of the optimal solutions by less than $0.3$% on average; ii) outperform the competitors, which include the conventional techniques from the heuristic search, i.e. weighted A*, as well as the state-of-the-art learnable planners.

 - **Abstract**
 Inter-modal interaction plays an indispensable role in multimodal sentiment analysis. Due to different modalities sequences are usually non-alignment, how to integrate relevant information of each modality to learn fusion representations has been one of the central challenges in multimodal learning. In this paper, a Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model (SA-FRLM) is proposed to learn robust crossmodal fusion representations directly from the unaligned text and audio sequences. Different from previous works, our model not only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but also maximizes the protection of the unimodal characteristics. Specifically, we first employ a crossmodal alignment module to project different modalities features to the same dimension. The crossmodal collaboration attention is then adopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences and initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the SA-FRLM, the crossmodal adjustment transformer is proposed to protect original unimodal characteristics. It can dynamically adapt the fusion representations by using single modal streams. We evaluate our approach on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results show that our model has significantly improved the performance of all the metrics on the unaligned text-audio sequences.
### Sum and Tensor of Quantitative Effects

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by the seminal work of Hyland, Plotkin, and Power on the combination of algebraic computational effects via sum and tensor, we develop an analogous theory for the combination of quantitative algebraic effects. Quantitative algebraic effects are monadic computational effects on categories of metric spaces, which, moreover, admit an algebraic presentation in the form of quantitative equational theories, a logical framework introduced by Mardare, Panangaden, and Plotkin that generalises equational logic to account for a concept of approximate equality. As our main result, we show that the sum and tensor of two quantitative equational theories correspond to the categorical sum (i.e., coproduct) and tensor, respectively, of their effects qua monads. We further give a theory of quantitative effect transformers based on these two operations, essentially providing quantitive analogues to the following monad transformers due to Moggi: exception, resumption, reader, and writer transformers. Finally, as an application we provide the first quantitative algebraic axiomatizations to the following coalgebraic structures: Markov processes, labelled Markov processes, Mealy machines, and Markov decision processes, each endowed with their respective bisimilarity metrics. Apart from the intrinsic interest in these axiomatizations, it is pleasing they have been obtained as the composition, via sum and tensor, of simpler quantitative equational theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Generic Object Tracking (GOT) is the problem of tracking target objects, specified by bounding boxes in the first frame of a video. While the task has received much attention in the last decades, researchers have almost exclusively focused on the single object setting. Multi-object GOT benefits from a wider applicability, rendering it more attractive in real-world applications. We attribute the lack of research interest into this problem to the absence of suitable benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale GOT benchmark, LaGOT, containing multiple annotated target objects per sequence. Our benchmark allows researchers to tackle key remaining challenges in GOT, aiming to increase robustness and reduce computation through joint tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a Transformer-based GOT tracker TaMOS capable of joint processing of multiple objects through shared computation. TaMOs achieves a 4x faster run-time in case of 10 concurrent objects compared to tracking each object independently and outperforms existing single object trackers on our new benchmark. Finally, TaMOs achieves highly competitive results on single-object GOT datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art on TrackingNet with a success rate AUC of 84.4%. Our benchmark, code, and trained models will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Text-based person search (TBPS) is of significant importance in intelligent surveillance, which aims to retrieve pedestrian images with high semantic relevance to a given text description. This retrieval task is characterized with both modal heterogeneity and fine-grained matching. To implement this task, one needs to extract multi-scale features from both image and text domains, and then perform the cross-modal alignment. However, most existing approaches only consider the alignment confined at their individual scales, e.g., an image-sentence or a region-phrase scale. Such a strategy adopts the presumable alignment in feature extraction, while overlooking the cross-scale alignment, e.g., image-phrase. In this paper, we present a transformer-based model to extract multi-scale representations, and perform Asymmetric Cross-Scale Alignment (ACSA) to precisely align the two modalities. Specifically, ACSA consists of a global-level alignment module and an asymmetric cross-attention module, where the former aligns an image and texts on a global scale, and the latter applies the cross-attention mechanism to dynamically align the cross-modal entities in region/image-phrase scales. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available at \href{url}{https://github.com/mul-hjh/ACSA}.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory input. All-optical diffractive neural networks provide a promising solution for realizing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption. To date, most of the reported diffractive neural networks focus on single or multiple tasks that do not involve interaction with the environment, such as object recognition and image classification, while the networks that can perform decision-making and control, to our knowledge, have not been developed yet. Here, we propose to use deep reinforcement learning to realize diffractive neural networks that enable imitating the human-level capability of decision-making and control. Such networks allow for finding optimal control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily realized with the dielectric metasurfaces. The superior performances of these networks are verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe, Super Mario Bros., and Car Racing, and achieving the same or even higher levels comparable to human players. Our work represents a solid step of advancement in diffractive neural networks, which promises a fundamental shift from the target-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or classification tasks to the high-level sensory capability of artificial intelligence. It may find exciting applications in autonomous driving, intelligent robots, and intelligent manufacturing.

 - **Abstract**
 Imitation learning (IL) is a simple and powerful way to use high-quality human driving data, which can be collected at scale, to identify driving preferences and produce human-like behavior. However, policies based on imitation learning alone often fail to sufficiently account for safety and reliability concerns. In this paper, we show how imitation learning combined with reinforcement learning using simple rewards can substantially improve the safety and reliability of driving policies over those learned from imitation alone. In particular, we use a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning to train a policy on over 100k miles of urban driving data, and measure its effectiveness in test scenarios grouped by different levels of collision risk. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a combined imitation and reinforcement learning approach in autonomous driving that utilizes large amounts of real-world human driving data.

 - **Abstract**
 Designing a local planner to control tractor-trailer vehicles in forward and backward maneuvering is a challenging control problem in the research community of autonomous driving systems. Considering a critical situation in the stability of tractor-trailer systems, a practical and novel approach is presented to design a non-linear MPC(NMPC) local planner for tractor-trailer autonomous vehicles in both forward and backward maneuvering. The tractor velocity and steering angle are considered to be control variables. The proposed NMPC local planner is designed to handle jackknife situations, avoiding multiple static obstacles, and path following in both forward and backward maneuvering. The challenges mentioned above are converted into a constrained problem that can be handled simultaneously by the proposed NMPC local planner. The direct multiple shooting approach is used to convert the optimal control problem(OCP) into a non-linear programming problem(NLP) that IPOPT solvers can solve in CasADi. The controller performance is evaluated through different backup and forward maneuvering scenarios in the Gazebo simulation environment in real-time. It achieves asymptotic stability in avoiding static obstacles and accurate tracking performance while respecting path constraints. Finally, the proposed NMPC local planner is integrated with an open-source autonomous driving software stack called AutowareAi.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual perception plays an important role in autonomous driving. One of the primary tasks is object detection and identification. Since the vision sensor is rich in color and texture information, it can quickly and accurately identify various road information. The commonly used technique is based on extracting and calculating various features of the image. The recent development of deep learning-based method has better reliability and processing speed and has a greater advantage in recognizing complex elements. For depth estimation, vision sensor is also used for ranging due to their small size and low cost. Monocular camera uses image data from a single viewpoint as input to estimate object depth. In contrast, stereo vision is based on parallax and matching feature points of different views, and the application of deep learning also further improves the accuracy. In addition, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) can establish a model of the road environment, thus helping the vehicle perceive the surrounding environment and complete the tasks. In this paper, we introduce and compare various methods of object detection and identification, then explain the development of depth estimation and compare various methods based on monocular, stereo, and RDBG sensors, next review and compare various methods of SLAM, and finally summarize the current problems and present the future development trends of vision technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recognizing the surrounding environment at low latency is critical in autonomous driving. In real-time environment, surrounding environment changes when processing is over. Current detection models are incapable of dealing with changes in the environment that occur after processing. Streaming perception is proposed to assess the latency and accuracy of real-time video perception. However, additional problems arise in real-world applications due to limited hardware resources, high temperatures, and other factors. In this study, we develop a model that can reflect processing delays in real time and produce the most reasonable results. By incorporating the proposed feature queue and feature select module, the system gains the ability to forecast specific time steps without any additional computational costs. Our method is tested on the Argoverse-HD dataset. It achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art methods(2022.10) in various environments when delayed .
