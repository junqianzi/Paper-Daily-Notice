 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR sensors are an integral part of modern autonomous vehicles as they provide an accurate, high-resolution 3D representation of the vehicle's surroundings. However, it is computationally difficult to make use of the ever-increasing amounts of data from multiple high-resolution LiDAR sensors. As frame-rates, point cloud sizes and sensor resolutions increase, real-time processing of these point clouds must still extract semantics from this increasingly precise picture of the vehicle's environment. One deciding factor of the run-time performance and accuracy of deep neural networks operating on these point clouds is the underlying data representation and the way it is computed. In this work, we examine the relationship between the computational representations used in neural networks and their performance characteristics. To this end, we propose a novel computational taxonomy of LiDAR point cloud representations used in modern deep neural networks for 3D point cloud processing. Using this taxonomy, we perform a structured analysis of different families of approaches. Thereby, we uncover common advantages and limitations in terms of computational efficiency, memory requirements, and representational capacity as measured by semantic segmentation performance. Finally, we provide some insights and guidance for future developments in neural point cloud processing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR depth-only completion is a challenging task to estimate dense depth maps only from sparse measurement points obtained by LiDAR. Even though the depth-only methods have been widely developed, there is still a significant performance gap with the RGB-guided methods that utilize extra color images. We find that existing depth-only methods can obtain satisfactory results in the areas where the measurement points are almost accurate and evenly distributed (denoted as normal areas), while the performance is limited in the areas where the foreground and background points are overlapped due to occlusion (denoted as overlap areas) and the areas where there are no measurement points around (denoted as blank areas) since the methods have no reliable input information in these areas. Building upon these observations, we propose an effective Coupled U-Net (CU-Net) architecture for depth-only completion. Instead of directly using a large network for regression, we employ the local U-Net to estimate accurate values in the normal areas and provide the global U-Net with reliable initial values in the overlap and blank areas. The depth maps predicted by the two coupled U-Nets are fused by learned confidence maps to obtain final results. In addition, we propose a confidence-based outlier removal module, which removes outliers using simple judgment conditions. Our proposed method boosts the final results with fewer parameters and achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark. Moreover, it owns a powerful generalization ability under various depth densities, varying lighting, and weather conditions.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14509
 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning algorithm are increasingly used for speech enhancement (SE). In supervised methods, global and local information is required for accurate spectral mapping. A key restriction is often poor capture of key contextual information. To leverage long-term for target speakers and compensate distortions of cleaned speech, this paper adopts a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) mapping structure and proposes a novel monaural speech enhancement system, consisting of a Feature Extraction Block (FEB), a Compensation Enhancement Block (ComEB) and a Mask Block (MB). In the FEB a U-net block is used to extract abstract features using complex-valued spectra with one path to suppress the background noise in the magnitude domain using masking methods and the MB takes magnitude features from the FEBand compensates the lost complex-domain features produced from ComEB to restore the final cleaned speech. Experiments are conducted on the Librispeech dataset and results show that the proposed model obtains better performance than recent models in terms of ESTOI and PESQ scores.

 - **Abstract**
 To meet the ever-increasing computation demand from emerging workloads, a scalable design paradigm combines multiple Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators to build a large multi-accelerator system. They are mainly proposed for data centers, where workload varies across vision, language, recommendation, etc. Existing works independently explore their hardware configuration and mapping strategies due to the extremely large cross-coupled design space. However, hardware and mapping are interdependent and, if not explored together, may lead to sub-optimal performance when workload changes. Moreover, even though a data center accelerator has multiple objectives, almost all the existing works prefer aggregating them into one (mono-objective). But aggregation does not help if the objectives are conflicting, as improving one will worsen the other. This work proposes MOHaM, a multi-objective hardware-mapping co-optimisation framework for multi-tenant DNN accelerators. Specifically, given an application model and a library of heterogeneous, parameterised and reconfigurable sub-accelerator templates, MOHaM returns a Pareto-optimal set of multi-accelerator systems with an optimal schedule for each one of them to minimise the overall system latency, energy and area. MOHaM is evaluated for diverse workload scenarios with state-of-the-art sub-accelerators. The Pareto-optimal set of competitive design choices enables selecting the best one as per the requirement.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent breakthroughs in semi-supervised semantic segmentation have been developed through contrastive learning. In prevalent pixel-wise contrastive learning solutions, the model maps pixels to deterministic representations and regularizes them in the latent space. However, there exist inaccurate pseudo-labels which map the ambiguous representations of pixels to the wrong classes due to the limited cognitive ability of the model. In this paper, we define pixel-wise representations from a new perspective of probability theory and propose a Probabilistic Representation Contrastive Learning (PRCL) framework that improves representation quality by taking its probability into consideration. Through modeling the mapping from pixels to representations as the probability via multivariate Gaussian distributions, we can tune the contribution of the ambiguous representations to tolerate the risk of inaccurate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we define prototypes in the form of distributions, which indicates the confidence of a class, while the point prototype cannot. Moreover, we propose to regularize the distribution variance to enhance the reliability of representations. Taking advantage of these benefits, high-quality feature representations can be derived in the latent space, thereby the performance of semantic segmentation can be further improved. We conduct sufficient experiment to evaluate PRCL on Pascal VOC and CityScapes. The comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the superiority of proposed PRCL.

 - **Abstract**
 Code-Switching refers to the phenomenon of switching languages within a sentence or discourse. However, limited code-switching , different language phoneme-sets and high rebuilding costs throw a challenge to make the specialized acoustic model for code-switching speech recognition. In this paper, we make use of limited code-switching data as driving materials and explore a shortcut to quickly develop intra-sentential code-switching recognition skill on the commissioned native language acoustic model, where we propose a data-driven method to make the seed lexicon which is used to train grapheme-to-phoneme model to predict mapping pronunciations for foreign language word in code-switching sentences. The core work of the data-driven technology in this paper consists of a phonetic decoding method and different selection methods. And for imbalanced word-level driving materials problem, we have an internal assistance inspiration that learning the good pronunciation rules in the words that possess sufficient materials using the grapheme-to-phoneme model to help the scarce. Our experiments show that the Mixed Error Rate in intra-sentential Chinese-English code-switching recognition reduced from 29.15\%, acquired on the pure Chinese recognizer, to 12.13\% by adding foreign language words' pronunciation through our data-driven approach, and finally get the best result 11.14\% with the combination of different selection methods and internal assistance tactic.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving is complex, requiring sophisticated 3D scene understanding, localization, mapping, and control. Rather than explicitly modelling and fusing each of these components, we instead consider an end-to-end approach via reinforcement learning (RL). However, collecting exploration driving data in the real world is impractical and dangerous. While training in simulation and deploying visual sim-to-real techniques has worked well for robot manipulation, deploying beyond controlled workspace viewpoints remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for off-road autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by learning to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation and depth maps, subsequently enabling real-world images to also be translated. This allows us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly deploy in the real-world. Our approach, which can be trained in 48 hours on 1 GPU, can perform equally as well as a classical perception and control stack that took thousands of engineering hours over several months to build. We hope this work motivates future end-to-end autonomous driving research.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14878
 - **Abstract**
 Duality of control and estimation allows mapping recent advances in data-guided control to the estimation setup. This paper formalizes and utilizes such a mapping by considering learning the optimal (steady-state) Kalman gain when process and measurement noise statistics are unknown. Specifically, building on the duality between synthesizing optimal control and estimation gains, the filter design problem is formalized as direct policy learning; subsequently, a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach is adopted to learn the optimal filter gain. In this direction, control and estimation duality is also used to extend existing theoretical results for direct policy updates for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to establish convergence of the proposed algorithm-while addressing subtle differences between the two synthesis problems. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-view geo-localization aims to estimate the GPS location of a query ground-view image by matching it to images from a reference database of geo-tagged aerial images. To address this challenging problem, recent approaches use panoramic ground-view images to increase the range of visibility. Although appealing, panoramic images are not readily available compared to the videos of limited Field-Of-View (FOV) images. In this paper, we present the first cross-view geo-localization method that works on a sequence of limited FOV images. Our model is trained end-to-end to capture the temporal structure that lies within the frames using the attention-based temporal feature aggregation module. To robustly tackle different sequences length and GPS noises during inference, we propose to use a sequential dropout scheme to simulate variant length sequences. To evaluate the proposed approach in realistic settings, we present a new large-scale dataset containing ground-view sequences along with the corresponding aerial-view images. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to several competitive baselines.
### Reconstruction from edge image combined with color and gradient  difference for industrial surface anomaly detection

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14485
 - **Abstract**
 Reconstruction-based methods are widely explored in industrial visual anomaly detection. Such methods commonly require the model to well reconstruct the normal patterns but fail in the anomalies, and thus the anomalies can be detected by evaluating the reconstruction errors. However, in practice, it's usually difficult to control the generalization boundary of the model. The model with an overly strong generalization capability can even well reconstruct the abnormal regions, making them less distinguishable, while the model with a poor generalization capability can not reconstruct those changeable high-frequency components in the normal regions, which ultimately leads to false positives. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new reconstruction network where we reconstruct the original RGB image from its gray value edges (EdgRec). Specifically, this is achieved by an UNet-type denoising autoencoder with skip connections. The input edge and skip connections can well preserve the high-frequency information in the original image. Meanwhile, the proposed restoration task can force the network to memorize the normal low-frequency and color information. Besides, the denoising design can prevent the model from directly copying the original high-frequent components. To evaluate the anomalies, we further propose a new interpretable hand-crafted evaluation function that considers both the color and gradient differences. Our method achieves competitive results on the challenging benchmark MVTec AD (97.8\% for detection and 97.7\% for localization, AUROC). In addition, we conduct experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and show convincing results using RGB images only. Our code will be available at https://github.com/liutongkun/EdgRec.

 - **Abstract**
 Because of the availability of larger datasets and recent improvements in the generative model, more realistic Deepfake videos are being produced each day. People consume around one billion hours of video on social media platforms every day, and thats why it is very important to stop the spread of fake videos as they can be damaging, dangerous, and malicious. There has been a significant improvement in the field of deepfake classification, but deepfake detection and inference have remained a difficult task. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose a novel DEEPFAKE C-L-I (Classification-Localization-Inference) in which we have explored the idea of accelerating Quantized Deepfake Detection Models using FPGAs due to their ability of maximum parallelism and energy efficiency compared to generalized GPUs. In this paper, we have used light MesoNet with EFF-YNet structure and accelerated it on VCK5000 FPGA, powered by state-of-the-art VC1902 Versal Architecture which uses AI, DSP, and Adaptable Engines for acceleration. We have benchmarked our inference speed with other state-of-the-art inference nodes, got 316.8 FPS on VCK5000 while maintaining 93\% Accuracy.
### Visual Answer Localization with Cross-modal Mutual Knowledge Transfer

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of visual answering localization (VAL) in the video is to obtain a relevant and concise time clip from a video as the answer to the given natural language question. Early methods are based on the interaction modeling between video and text to predict the visual answer by the visual predictor. Later, using textual predictor with subtitles for the VAL proves to be more precise. However, these existing methods still have cross-modal knowledge deviations from visual frames or textual subtitles. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal mutual knowledge transfer span localization (MutualSL) method to reduce the knowledge deviation. MutualSL has both visual predictor and textual predictor, where we expect the prediction results of these both to be consistent, so as to promote semantic knowledge understanding between cross-modalities. On this basis, we design a one-way dynamic loss function to dynamically adjust the proportion of knowledge transferring. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets for evaluation. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Explicitly Increasing Input Information Density for Vision Transformers  on Small Datasets

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformers have attracted a lot of attention recently since the successful implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) on vision tasks. With vision Transformers, specifically the multi-head self-attention modules, networks can capture long-term dependencies inherently. However, these attention modules normally need to be trained on large datasets, and vision Transformers show inferior performance on small datasets when training from scratch compared with widely dominant backbones like ResNets. Note that the Transformer model was first proposed for natural language processing, which carries denser information than natural images. To boost the performance of vision Transformers on small datasets, this paper proposes to explicitly increase the input information density in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce selecting channels by calculating the channel-wise heatmaps in the frequency domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), reducing the size of input while keeping most information and hence increasing the information density. As a result, 25% fewer channels are kept while better performance is achieved compared with previous work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on five small-scale datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, Flowers-102, and Tiny ImageNet. The accuracy has been boosted up to 17.05% with Swin and Focal Transformers. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiangyu8/DenseVT.

 - **Abstract**
 Multilingual transformer language models have recently attracted much attention from researchers and are used in cross-lingual transfer learning for many NLP tasks such as text classification and named entity recognition. However, similar methods for transfer learning from monolingual text to code-switched text have not been extensively explored mainly due to the following challenges: (1) Code-switched corpus, unlike monolingual corpus, consists of more than one language and existing methods can't be applied efficiently, (2) Code-switched corpus is usually made of resource-rich and low-resource languages and upon using multilingual pre-trained language models, the final model might bias towards resource-rich language. In this paper, we focus on code-switched sentiment analysis where we have a labelled resource-rich language dataset and unlabelled code-switched data. We propose a framework that takes the distinction between resource-rich and low-resource language into account. Instead of training on the entire code-switched corpus at once, we create buckets based on the fraction of words in the resource-rich language and progressively train from resource-rich language dominated samples to low-resource language dominated samples. Extensive experiments across multiple language pairs demonstrate that progressive training helps low-resource language dominated samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have recently been utilized to perform object detection and tracking in the context of autonomous driving. One unique characteristic of these models is that attention weights are computed in each forward pass, giving insights into the model's interior, in particular, which part of the input data it deemed interesting for the given task. Such an attention matrix with the input grid is available for each detected (or tracked) object in every transformer decoder layer. In this work, we investigate the distribution of these attention weights: How do they change through the decoder layers and through the lifetime of a track? Can they be used to infer additional information about an object, such as a detection uncertainty? Especially in unstructured environments, or environments that were not common during training, a reliable measure of detection uncertainty is crucial to decide whether the system can still be trusted or not.

 - **Abstract**
 Text erasure from an image is helpful for various tasks such as image editing and privacy preservation. In this paper, we present TPFNet, a novel one-stage (end-toend) network for text removal from images. Our network has two parts: feature synthesis and image generation. Since noise can be more effectively removed from low-resolution images, part 1 operates on low-resolution images. The output of part 1 is a low-resolution text-free image. Part 2 uses the features learned in part 1 to predict a high-resolution text-free image. In part 1, we use "pyramidal vision transformer" (PVT) as the encoder. Further, we use a novel multi-headed decoder that generates a high-pass filtered image and a segmentation map, in addition to a text-free image. The segmentation branch helps locate the text precisely, and the high-pass branch helps in learning the image structure. To precisely locate the text, TPFNet employs an adversarial loss that is conditional on the segmentation map rather than the input image. On Oxford, SCUT, and SCUT-EnsText datasets, our network outperforms recently proposed networks on nearly all the metrics. For example, on SCUT-EnsText dataset, TPFNet has a PSNR (higher is better) of 39.0 and text-detection precision (lower is better) of 21.1, compared to the best previous technique, which has a PSNR of 32.3 and precision of 53.2.

 - **Abstract**
 Inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to comprehend the underlying semantics and logic patterns of relations. With the advance of pretrained language models, recent research have designed transformers for link prediction tasks. However, empirical studies show that linearizing triples affects the learning of relational patterns, such as inversion and symmetry. In this paper, we propose Bi-Link, a contrastive learning framework with probabilistic syntax prompts for link predictions. Using grammatical knowledge of BERT, we efficiently search for relational prompts according to learnt syntactical patterns that generalize to large knowledge graphs. To better express symmetric relations, we design a symmetric link prediction model, establishing bidirectional linking between forward prediction and backward prediction. This bidirectional linking accommodates flexible self-ensemble strategies at test time. In our experiments, Bi-Link outperforms recent baselines on link prediction datasets (WN18RR, FB15K-237, and Wikidata5M). Furthermore, we construct Zeshel-Ind as an in-domain inductive entity linking the environment to evaluate Bi-Link. The experimental results demonstrate that our method yields robust representations which can generalize under domain shift.

 - **Abstract**
 Data scarcity is a widespread problem in numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks for low-resource languages. Within morphology, the labour-intensive work of tagging/glossing data is a serious bottleneck for both NLP and language documentation. Active learning (AL) aims to reduce the cost of data annotation by selecting data that is most informative for improving the model. In this paper, we explore four sampling strategies for the task of morphological inflection using a Transformer model: a pair of oracle experiments where data is chosen based on whether the model already can or cannot inflect the test forms correctly, as well as strategies based on high/low model confidence, entropy, as well as random selection. We investigate the robustness of each strategy across 30 typologically diverse languages. We also perform a more in-depth case study of Nat\"ugu. Our results show a clear benefit to selecting data based on model confidence and entropy. Unsurprisingly, the oracle experiment, where only incorrectly handled forms are chosen for further training, which is presented as a proxy for linguist/language consultant feedback, shows the most improvement. This is followed closely by choosing low-confidence and high-entropy predictions. We also show that despite the conventional wisdom of larger data sets yielding better accuracy, introducing more instances of high-confidence or low-entropy forms, or forms that the model can already inflect correctly, can reduce model performance.

 - **Abstract**
 The lack of annotated training data in bioacoustics hinders the use of large-scale neural network models trained in a supervised way. In order to leverage a large amount of unannotated audio data, we propose AVES (Animal Vocalization Encoder based on Self-Supervision), a self-supervised, transformer-based audio representation model for encoding animal vocalizations. We pretrain AVES on a diverse set of unannotated audio datasets and fine-tune them for downstream bioacoustics tasks. Comprehensive experiments with a suite of classification and detection tasks have shown that AVES outperforms all the strong baselines and even the supervised "topline" models trained on annotated audio classification datasets. The results also suggest that curating a small training subset related to downstream tasks is an efficient way to train high-quality audio representation models. We open-source our models at \url{https://github.com/earthspecies/aves}.

 - **Abstract**
 Video-based dialog task is a challenging multimodal learning task that has received increasing attention over the past few years with state-of-the-art obtaining new performance records. This progress is largely powered by the adaptation of the more powerful transformer-based language encoders. Despite this progress, existing approaches do not effectively utilize visual features to help solve tasks. Recent studies show that state-of-the-art models are biased toward textual information rather than visual cues. In order to better leverage the available visual information, this study proposes a new framework that combines 3D-CNN network and transformer-based networks into a single visual encoder to extract more robust semantic representations from videos. The visual encoder is jointly trained end-to-end with other input modalities such as text and audio. Experiments on the AVSD task show significant improvement over baselines in both generative and retrieval tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Sequential recommendation (SR) plays an important role in personalized recommender systems because it captures dynamic and diverse preferences from users' real-time increasing behaviors. Unlike the standard autoregressive training strategy, future data (also available during training) has been used to facilitate model training as it provides richer signals about user's current interests and can be used to improve the recommendation quality. However, these methods suffer from a severe training-inference gap, i.e., both past and future contexts are modeled by the same encoder when training, while only historical behaviors are available during inference. This discrepancy leads to potential performance degradation. To alleviate the training-inference gap, we propose a new framework DualRec, which achieves past-future disentanglement and past-future mutual enhancement by a novel dual network. Specifically, a dual network structure is exploited to model the past and future context separately. And a bi-directional knowledge transferring mechanism enhances the knowledge learnt by the dual network. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baseline methods. Besides, we demonstrate the compatibility of DualRec by instantiating using RNN, Transformer, and filter-MLP as backbones. Further empirical analysis verifies the high utility of modeling future contexts under our DualRec framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Alternatives to backpropagation have long been studied to better understand how biological brains may learn. Recently, they have also garnered interest as a way to train neural networks more efficiently. By relaxing constraints inherent to backpropagation (e.g., symmetric feedforward and feedback weights, sequential updates), these methods enable promising prospects, such as local learning. However, the tradeoffs between different methods in terms of final task performance, convergence speed, and ultimately compute and data requirements are rarely outlined. In this work, we use scaling laws to study the ability of Direct Feedback Alignment~(DFA) to train causal decoder-only Transformers efficiently. Scaling laws provide an overview of the tradeoffs implied by a modeling decision, up to extrapolating how it might transfer to increasingly large models. We find that DFA fails to offer more efficient scaling than backpropagation: there is never a regime for which the degradation in loss incurred by using DFA is worth the potential reduction in compute budget. Our finding comes at variance with previous beliefs in the alternative training methods community, and highlights the need for holistic empirical approaches to better understand modeling decisions.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple-object tracking (MOT) is a challenging task that requires simultaneous reasoning about location, appearance, and identity of the objects in the scene over time. Our aim in this paper is to move beyond tracking-by-detection approaches, that perform well on datasets where the object classes are known, to class-agnostic tracking that performs well also for unknown object classes.To this end, we make the following three contributions: first, we introduce {\em semantic detector queries} that enable an object to be localized by specifying its approximate position, or its appearance, or both; second, we use these queries within an auto-regressive framework for tracking, and propose a multi-query tracking transformer (\textit{MQT}) model for simultaneous tracking and appearance-based re-identification (reID) based on the transformer architecture with deformable attention. This formulation allows the tracker to operate in a class-agnostic manner, and the model can be trained end-to-end; finally, we demonstrate that \textit{MQT} performs competitively on standard MOT benchmarks, outperforms all baselines on generalised-MOT, and generalises well to a much harder tracking problems such as tracking any object on the TAO dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Myocarditis is among the most important cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), endangering the health of many individuals by damaging the myocardium. Microbes and viruses, such as HIV, play a vital role in myocarditis disease (MCD) incidence. Lack of MCD diagnosis in the early stages is associated with irreversible complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is highly popular among cardiologists to diagnose CVDs. In this paper, a deep learning (DL) based computer-aided diagnosis system (CADS) is presented for the diagnosis of MCD using CMRI images. The proposed CADS includes dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and post-processing steps. First, the Z-Alizadeh dataset was selected for the experiments. The preprocessing step included noise removal, image resizing, and data augmentation (DA). In this step, CutMix, and MixUp techniques were used for the DA. Then, the most recent pre-trained and transformers models were used for feature extraction and classification using CMRI images. Our results show high performance for the detection of MCD using transformer models compared with the pre-trained architectures. Among the DL architectures, Turbulence Neural Transformer (TNT) architecture achieved an accuracy of 99.73% with 10-fold cross-validation strategy. Explainable-based Grad Cam method is used to visualize the MCD suspected areas in CMRI images.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent mainstream weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches are mainly based on Class Activation Map (CAM) generated by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based image classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework, named Semantic Guided Activation Transformer (SemFormer), for WSSS. We design a transformer-based Class-Aware AutoEncoder (CAAE) to extract the class embeddings for the input image and learn class semantics for all classes of the dataset. The class embeddings and learned class semantics are then used to guide the generation of activation maps with four losses, i.e., class-foreground, class-background, activation suppression, and activation complementation loss. Experimental results show that our SemFormer achieves \textbf{74.3}\% mIoU and surpasses many recent mainstream WSSS approaches by a large margin on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/JLChen-C/SemFormer}.

 - **Abstract**
 Human intention prediction is a growing area of research where an activity in a video has to be anticipated by a vision-based system. To this end, the model creates a representation of the past, and subsequently, it produces future hypotheses about upcoming scenarios. In this work, we focus on pedestrians' early intention prediction in which, from a current observation of an urban scene, the model predicts the future activity of pedestrians that approach the street. Our method is based on a multi-modal transformer that encodes past observations and produces multiple predictions at different anticipation times. Moreover, we propose to learn the attention masks of our transformer-based model (Temporal Adaptive Mask Transformer) in order to weigh differently present and past temporal dependencies. We investigate our method on several public benchmarks for early intention prediction, improving the prediction performances at different anticipation times compared to the previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of speech emotion recognition (SER) is to identify the emotional aspects of speech. The SER challenge for Brazilian Portuguese speech was proposed with short snippets of Portuguese which are classified as neutral, non-neutral female and non-neutral male according to paralinguistic elements (laughing, crying, etc). This dataset contains about $50$ minutes of Brazilian Portuguese speech. As the dataset leans on the small side, we investigate whether a combination of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques can produce positive results. Thus, by combining a data augmentation technique called SpecAugment, with the use of Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) for transfer learning we are able to obtain interesting results. The PANNs (CNN6, CNN10 and CNN14) are pretrained on a large dataset called AudioSet containing more than $5000$ hours of audio. They were finetuned on the SER dataset and the best performing model (CNN10) on the validation set was submitted to the challenge, achieving an $F1$ score of $0.73$ up from $0.54$ from the baselines provided by the challenge. Moreover, we also tested the use of Transformer neural architecture, pretrained on about $600$ hours of Brazilian Portuguese audio data. Transformers, as well as more complex models of PANNs (CNN14), fail to generalize to the test set in the SER dataset and do not beat the baseline. Considering the limitation of the dataset sizes, currently the best approach for SER is using PANNs (specifically, CNN6 and CNN10).

 - **Abstract**
 The recent emergence of joint CTC-Attention model shows significant improvement in automatic speech recognition (ASR). The improvement largely lies in the modeling of linguistic information by decoder. The decoder joint-optimized with an acoustic encoder renders the language model from ground-truth sequences in an auto-regressive manner during training. However, the training corpus of the decoder is limited to the speech transcriptions, which is far less than the corpus needed to train an acceptable language model. This leads to poor robustness of decoder. To alleviate this problem, we propose linguistic-enhanced transformer, which introduces refined CTC information to decoder during training process, so that the decoder can be more robust. Our experiments on AISHELL-1 speech corpus show that the character error rate (CER) is relatively reduced by up to 7%. We also find that in joint CTC-Attention ASR model, decoder is more sensitive to linguistic information than acoustic information.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

### Analyzing Distribution Transformer Degradation with Increased Power  Electronic Loads

 - **Abstract**
 The influx of non-linear power electronic loads into the distribution network has the potential to disrupt the existing distribution transformer operations. They were not designed to mediate the excessive heating losses generated from the harmonics. To have a good understanding of current standing challenges, a knowledge of the generation and load mix as well as the current harmonic estimations are essential for designing transformers and evaluating their performance. In this paper, we investigate a mixture of essential power electronic loads for a household designed in PSCAD/EMTdc and their potential impacts on transformer eddy current losses and derating using harmonic analysis. The various scenarios have been studied with increasing PV penetrations. The peak load conditions are chosen for each scenario to perform a transformer derating analysis. Our findings reveal that in the presence of high power electronic loads (especially third harmonics), along with increasing PV generation may worsen transformer degradation. However, with a low amount of power electronic loads, additional PV generation helps to reduce the harmonic content in the current and improve transformer performance.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we elaborate upon recipes for building multilingual representation models that are not only competitive with existing state-of-the-art models but are also more parameter efficient, thereby promoting better adoption in resource-constrained scenarios and practical applications. We show that going beyond English-centric bitexts, coupled with a novel sampling strategy aimed at reducing under-utilization of training data, substantially boosts performance across model sizes for both Electra and MLM pre-training objectives. We introduce XY-LENT: X-Y bitext enhanced Language ENcodings using Transformers which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance over 5 cross-lingual tasks within all model size bands, is also competitive across bands. Our XY-LENT XL variant outperforms XLM-RXXL and exhibits competitive performance with mT5 XXL while being 5x and 6x smaller respectively. We then show that our proposed method helps ameliorate the curse of multilinguality, with the XY-LENT XL achieving 99.3% GLUE performance and 98.5% SQuAD 2.0 performance compared to a SoTA English only model in the same size band. We then analyze our models performance on extremely low resource languages and posit that scaling alone may not be sufficient for improving the performance in this scenario
### Learning a Task-specific Descriptor for Robust Matching of 3D Point  Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Existing learning-based point feature descriptors are usually task-agnostic, which pursue describing the individual 3D point clouds as accurate as possible. However, the matching task aims at describing the corresponding points consistently across different 3D point clouds. Therefore these too accurate features may play a counterproductive role due to the inconsistent point feature representations of correspondences caused by the unpredictable noise, partiality, deformation, \etc, in the local geometry. In this paper, we propose to learn a robust task-specific feature descriptor to consistently describe the correct point correspondence under interference. Born with an Encoder and a Dynamic Fusion module, our method EDFNet develops from two aspects. First, we augment the matchability of correspondences by utilizing their repetitive local structure. To this end, a special encoder is designed to exploit two input point clouds jointly for each point descriptor. It not only captures the local geometry of each point in the current point cloud by convolution, but also exploits the repetitive structure from paired point cloud by Transformer. Second, we propose a dynamical fusion module to jointly use different scale features. There is an inevitable struggle between robustness and discriminativeness of the single scale feature. Specifically, the small scale feature is robust since little interference exists in this small receptive field. But it is not sufficiently discriminative as there are many repetitive local structures within a point cloud. Thus the resultant descriptors will lead to many incorrect matches. In contrast, the large scale feature is more discriminative by integrating more neighborhood information. ...

### Can Transformer Attention Spread Give Insights Into Uncertainty of  Detected and Tracked Objects?

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have recently been utilized to perform object detection and tracking in the context of autonomous driving. One unique characteristic of these models is that attention weights are computed in each forward pass, giving insights into the model's interior, in particular, which part of the input data it deemed interesting for the given task. Such an attention matrix with the input grid is available for each detected (or tracked) object in every transformer decoder layer. In this work, we investigate the distribution of these attention weights: How do they change through the decoder layers and through the lifetime of a track? Can they be used to infer additional information about an object, such as a detection uncertainty? Especially in unstructured environments, or environments that were not common during training, a reliable measure of detection uncertainty is crucial to decide whether the system can still be trusted or not.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactive traffic simulation is crucial to autonomous driving systems by enabling testing for planners in a more scalable and safe way compared to real-world road testing. Existing approaches learn an agent model from large-scale driving data to simulate realistic traffic scenarios, yet it remains an open question to produce consistent and diverse multi-agent interactive behaviors in crowded scenes. In this work, we present InterSim, an interactive traffic simulator for testing autonomous driving planners. Given a test plan trajectory from the ego agent, InterSim reasons about the interaction relations between the agents in the scene and generates realistic trajectories for each environment agent that are consistent with the relations. We train and validate our model on a large-scale interactive driving dataset. Experiment results show that InterSim achieves better simulation realism and reactivity in two simulation tasks compared to a state-of-the-art learning-based traffic simulator.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous driving is complex, requiring sophisticated 3D scene understanding, localization, mapping, and control. Rather than explicitly modelling and fusing each of these components, we instead consider an end-to-end approach via reinforcement learning (RL). However, collecting exploration driving data in the real world is impractical and dangerous. While training in simulation and deploying visual sim-to-real techniques has worked well for robot manipulation, deploying beyond controlled workspace viewpoints remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for off-road autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by learning to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation and depth maps, subsequently enabling real-world images to also be translated. This allows us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly deploy in the real-world. Our approach, which can be trained in 48 hours on 1 GPU, can perform equally as well as a classical perception and control stack that took thousands of engineering hours over several months to build. We hope this work motivates future end-to-end autonomous driving research.
