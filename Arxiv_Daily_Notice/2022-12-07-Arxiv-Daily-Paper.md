 - **Abstract**
 We introduce PRISM, a method for real-time filtering in a probabilistic generative model of agent motion and visual perception. Previous approaches either lack uncertainty estimates for the map and agent state, do not run in real-time, do not have a dense scene representation or do not model agent dynamics. Our solution reconciles all of these aspects. We start from a predefined state-space model which combines differentiable rendering and 6-DoF dynamics. Probabilistic inference in this model amounts to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and is intractable. We use a series of approximations to Bayesian inference to arrive at probabilistic map and state estimates. We take advantage of well-established methods and closed-form updates, preserving accuracy and enabling real-time capability. The proposed solution runs at 10Hz real-time and is similarly accurate to state-of-the-art SLAM in small to medium-sized indoor environments, with high-speed UAV and handheld camera agents (Blackbird, EuRoC and TUM-RGBD).

 - **Abstract**
 Maneuverability and drivability of the teleoperated ground vehicle could be seriously degraded by large communication delays if the delays are not properly compensated. This paper proposes a predicted trajectory guidance control (PTGC) framework to compensate for such delays, thereby improving the performance of the teleoperation system. The novelty of this PTGC framework is that teleoperators intended trajectory is predicted at the vehicle side with their delayed historical control commands and the LiDAR 3D point cloud of the environment, and then the vehicle is guided by the predicted trajectory. By removing the teleoperator from the direct control loop, the presented method is less sensitive to delays, and delays are compensated as long as the prediction horizon exceeds the delays. Human-in-the-loop simulation experiments are designed to evaluate the teleoperation performance with the proposed method under five delay levels. Based on the repeated measurement analysis of variance, it is concluded that the PTGC method can significantly improve the performance of the teleoperated ground vehicles under large delays(>200ms), such as the task completion time (TCT), deviation to centerline (D2C) and steering effort (SE). In addition, the results also show that teleoperators can adapt to smaller delays, and the presented method is ineffective in such cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining accurate bird's eye view (BEV) positions of objects and tracks in a scene is vital for various perception tasks including object interactions mapping, scenario extraction etc., however, the level of supervision required to accomplish that is extremely challenging to procure. We propose a light-weight, weakly supervised method to estimate 3D position of objects by jointly learning to regress the 2D object detections and scene's depth prediction in a single feed-forward pass of a network. Our proposed method extends a center-point based single-shot object detector \cite{zhou2019objects}, and introduces a novel object representation where each object is modeled as a BEV point spatio-temporally, without the need of any 3D or BEV annotations for training and LiDAR data at query time. The approach leverages readily available 2D object supervision along with LiDAR point clouds (used only during training) to jointly train a single network, that learns to predict 2D object detection alongside the whole scene's depth, to spatio-temporally model object tracks as points in BEV. The proposed method is computationally over $\sim$10x efficient compared to recent SOTA approaches [1, 38] while achieving comparable accuracies on KITTI tracking benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual localization plays an important role for intelligent robots and autonomous driving, especially when the accuracy of GNSS is unreliable. Recently, camera localization in LiDAR maps has attracted more and more attention for its low cost and potential robustness to illumination and weather changes. However, the commonly used pinhole camera has a narrow Field-of-View, thus leading to limited information compared with the omni-directional LiDAR data. To overcome this limitation, we focus on correlating the information of 360 equirectangular images to point clouds, proposing an end-to-end learnable network to conduct cross-modal visual localization by establishing similarity in high-dimensional feature space. Inspired by the attention mechanism, we optimize the network to capture the salient feature for comparing images and point clouds. We construct several sequences containing 360 equirectangular images and corresponding point clouds based on the KITTI-360 dataset and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR-based 3D object detection is an indispensable task in advanced autonomous driving systems. Though impressive detection results have been achieved by superior 3D detectors, they suffer from significant performance degeneration when facing unseen domains, such as different LiDAR configurations, different cities, and weather conditions. The mainstream approaches tend to solve these challenges by leveraging unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these UDA solutions just yield unsatisfactory 3D detection results when there is a severe domain shift, e.g., from Waymo (64-beam) to nuScenes (32-beam). To address this, we present a novel Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation method for 3D object detection (SSDA3D), where only a few labeled target data is available, yet can significantly improve the adaptation performance. In particular, our SSDA3D includes an Inter-domain Adaptation stage and an Intra-domain Generalization stage. In the first stage, an Inter-domain Point-CutMix module is presented to efficiently align the point cloud distribution across domains. The Point-CutMix generates mixed samples of an intermediate domain, thus encouraging to learn domain-invariant knowledge. Then, in the second stage, we further enhance the model for better generalization on the unlabeled target set. This is achieved by exploring Intra-domain Point-MixUp in semi-supervised learning, which essentially regularizes the pseudo label distribution. Experiments from Waymo to nuScenes show that, with only 10% labeled target data, our SSDA3D can surpass the fully-supervised oracle model with 100% target label. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinjunbo/SSDA3D.

 - **Abstract**
 3D gaze estimation is most often tackled as learning a direct mapping between input images and the gaze vector or its spherical coordinates. Recently, it has been shown that pose estimation of the face, body and hands benefits from revising the learning target from few pose parameters to dense 3D coordinates. In this work, we leverage this observation and propose to tackle 3D gaze estimation as regression of 3D eye meshes. We overcome the absence of compatible ground truth by fitting a rigid 3D eyeball template on existing gaze datasets and propose to improve generalization by making use of widely available in-the-wild face images. To this end, we propose an automatic pipeline to retrieve robust gaze pseudo-labels from arbitrary face images and design a multi-view supervision framework to balance their effect during training. In our experiments, our method achieves improvement of 30% compared to state-of-the-art in cross-dataset gaze estimation, when no ground truth data are available for training, and 7% when they are. We make our project publicly available at https://github.com/Vagver/dense3Deyes.

 - **Abstract**
 The deployment of neural networks on heterogeneous SoCs coupled with custom accelerators is a challenging task because of the lack of end-to-end software tools provided for these systems. Moreover, the already available low level schedules and mapping strategies provided by the accelerator developers for typical tensor operations are not necessarily the best possible ones for each particular use case. This is why frameworks which automatically test the performance of the generated code on a specific hardware configuration are of special interest. In this work, the integration between the code generation framework TVM and the systolic array-based accelerator Gemmini is presented. A generic schedule to offload the GEneral Matrix Multiply (GEMM) tensor operation onto Gemmini is detailed, and its suitability is tested by executing the AutoTVM tuning process on it. Our generated code achieves a peak throughput of 46 giga-operations per second (GOPs) under a 100 MHz clock on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA, outperforming previous work. Furthermore, the code generated by this integration was able to surpass the default hand-tuned schedules provided by the Gemmini developers in real-world workloads.

 - **Abstract**
 Topology optimization is one of the engineering tools for finding efficient design. For the material interpolation scheme, it is usual to employ the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) or the homogenization based interpolation function for the parameterization of the material properties with respect to the design variables assigned to each finite element. For topology optimization with single material design, i.e., solid or void, the parameterization with 1 for solid and 0 for void becomes relatively straight forward using a polynomial function. For the case of multiple materials, some issues of the equality modeling of each material and \textcolor{red}{the clear 0, 1 result of each element for the topology optimization} issues become serious because of the curse of the dimension. To relieve these issues, this research proposes a new mapping based interpolation function for multi-material topology optimization. Unlike the polynomial based interpolation, this new interpolation is formulated by the ratio of the $p$-norm of the design variables to the 1-norm of the design variable multiplied by the design variable for a specific material. With this alternative mapping based interpolation function, each material are equally modeled and \textcolor{red}{ the clear 0, 1 result of each material for the multi-material topology optimization model} can be improved. This paper solves several topology optimization problems to prove the validity of the present interpolation function.

 - **Abstract**
 The challenge of imbalanced learning lies not only in class imbalance problem, but also in the class overlapping problem which is complex. However, most of the existing algorithms mainly focus on the former. The limitation prevents the existing methods from breaking through. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm based on dual clustering and stage-wise hybrid sampling (DCSHS). The DCSHS has three parts. Firstly, we design a projection clustering combination framework (PCC) guided by Davies-Bouldin clustering effectiveness index (DBI), which is used to obtain high-quality clusters and combine them to obtain a set of cross-complete subsets (CCS) with balanced class and low overlapping. Secondly, according to the characteristics of subset classes, a stage-wise hybrid sampling algorithm is designed to realize the de-overlapping and balancing of subsets. Finally, a projective clustering transfer mapping mechanism (CTM) is constructed for all processed subsets by means of transfer learning, thereby reducing class overlapping and explore structure information of samples. The major advantage of our algorithm is that it can exploit the intersectionality of the CCS to realize the soft elimination of overlapping majority samples, and learn as much information of overlapping samples as possible, thereby enhancing the class overlapping while class balancing. In the experimental section, more than 30 public datasets and over ten representative algorithms are chosen for verification. The experimental results show that the DCSHS is significantly best in terms of various evaluation criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) have rapidly become a \textit{de facto} choice for medical image understanding tasks. However, DNNs are notoriously fragile to the class imbalance in image classification. We further point out that such imbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks such as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly complex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology can have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying demographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to recognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training data. In this paper, we propose to use pruning to automatically and adaptively identify \textit{hard-to-learn} (HTL) training samples, and improve pathology localization by attending them explicitly, during training in \textit{supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly-supervised} settings. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep classification models have difficult-to-memorize samples and those may be effectively exposed through network pruning \cite{hooker2019compressed} - and we extend such observation beyond classification for the first time. We also present an interesting demographic analysis which illustrates HTLs ability to capture complex demographic imbalances. Our extensive experiments on the Skin Lesion Localization task in multiple training settings by paying additional attention to HTLs show significant improvement of localization performance by $\sim$2-3\%.
### Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Object-wise Contrastive Learning  and Regression Uncertainty

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02747
 - **Abstract**
 Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to boost detection performance by leveraging extra unlabeled data. The teacher-student framework has been shown to be promising for SSOD, in which a teacher network generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to assist the training of a student network. Since the pseudo-labels are noisy, filtering the pseudo-labels is crucial to exploit the potential of such framework. Unlike existing suboptimal methods, we propose a two-step pseudo-label filtering for the classification and regression heads in a teacher-student framework. For the classification head, OCL (Object-wise Contrastive Learning) regularizes the object representation learning that utilizes unlabeled data to improve pseudo-label filtering by enhancing the discriminativeness of the classification score. This is designed to pull together objects in the same class and push away objects from different classes. For the regression head, we further propose RUPL (Regression-Uncertainty-guided Pseudo-Labeling) to learn the aleatoric uncertainty of object localization for label filtering. By jointly filtering the pseudo-labels for the classification and regression heads, the student network receives better guidance from the teacher network for object detection task. Experimental results on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method with competitive performance compared to existing methods.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03177
 - **Abstract**
 We present a robust, privacy-preserving visual localization algorithm using event cameras. While event cameras can potentially make robust localization due to high dynamic range and small motion blur, the sensors exhibit large domain gaps making it difficult to directly apply conventional image-based localization algorithms. To mitigate the gap, we propose applying event-to-image conversion prior to localization which leads to stable localization. In the privacy perspective, event cameras capture only a fraction of visual information compared to normal cameras, and thus can naturally hide sensitive visual details. To further enhance the privacy protection in our event-based pipeline, we introduce privacy protection at two levels, namely sensor and network level. Sensor level protection aims at hiding facial details with lightweight filtering while network level protection targets hiding the entire user's view in private scene applications using a novel neural network inference pipeline. Both levels of protection involve light-weight computation and incur only a small performance loss. We thus project our method to serve as a building block for practical location-based services using event cameras. The code and dataset will be made public through the following link: https://github.com/82magnolia/event_localization.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose Universal Document Processing (UDOP), a foundation Document AI model which unifies text, image, and layout modalities together with varied task formats, including document understanding and generation. UDOP leverages the spatial correlation between textual content and document image to model image, text, and layout modalities with one uniform representation. With a novel Vision-Text-Layout Transformer, UDOP unifies pretraining and multi-domain downstream tasks into a prompt-based sequence generation scheme. UDOP is pretrained on both large-scale unlabeled document corpora using innovative self-supervised objectives and diverse labeled data. UDOP also learns to generate document images from text and layout modalities via masked image reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the field of document AI that one model simultaneously achieves high-quality neural document editing and content customization. Our method sets the state-of-the-art on 9 Document AI tasks, e.g., document understanding and QA, across diverse data domains like finance reports, academic papers, and websites. UDOP ranks first on the leaderboard of the Document Understanding Benchmark (DUE).
### Transformers for End-to-End InfoSec Tasks: A Feasibility Study

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we assess the viability of transformer models in end-to-end InfoSec settings, in which no intermediate feature representations or processing steps occur outside the model. We implement transformer models for two distinct InfoSec data formats - specifically URLs and PE files - in a novel end-to-end approach, and explore a variety of architectural designs, training regimes, and experimental settings to determine the ingredients necessary for performant detection models. We show that in contrast to conventional transformers trained on more standard NLP-related tasks, our URL transformer model requires a different training approach to reach high performance levels. Specifically, we show that 1) pre-training on a massive corpus of unlabeled URL data for an auto-regressive task does not readily transfer to binary classification of malicious or benign URLs, but 2) that using an auxiliary auto-regressive loss improves performance when training from scratch. We introduce a method for mixed objective optimization, which dynamically balances contributions from both loss terms so that neither one of them dominates. We show that this method yields quantitative evaluation metrics comparable to that of several top-performing benchmark classifiers. Unlike URLs, binary executables contain longer and more distributed sequences of information-rich bytes. To accommodate such lengthy byte sequences, we introduce additional context length into the transformer by providing its self-attention layers with an adaptive span similar to Sukhbaatar et al. We demonstrate that this approach performs comparably to well-established malware detection models on benchmark PE file datasets, but also point out the need for further exploration into model improvements in scalability and compute efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Many state-of-the-art deep learning models for computer vision tasks are based on the transformer architecture. Such models can be computationally expensive and are typically statically set to meet the deployment scenario. However, in real-time applications, the resources available for every inference can vary considerably and be smaller than what state-of-the-art models use. We can use dynamic models to adapt the model execution to meet real-time application resource constraints. While prior dynamic work has primarily minimized resource utilization for less complex input images while maintaining accuracy and focused on CNNs and early transformer models such as BERT, we adapt vision transformers to meet system dynamic resource constraints, independent of the input image. We find that unlike early transformer models, recent state-of-the-art vision transformers heavily rely on convolution layers. We show that pretrained models are fairly resilient to skipping computation in the convolution and self-attention layers, enabling us to create a low-overhead system for dynamic real-time inference without additional training. Finally, we create a optimized accelerator for these dynamic vision transformers in a 5nm technology. The PE array occupies 2.26mm$^2$ and is 17 times faster than a NVIDIA TITAN V GPU for state-of-the-art transformer-based models for semantic segmentation.
### LUNA: Language Understanding with Number Augmentations on Transformers  via Number Plugins and Pre-training

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers are widely used in NLP tasks. However, current approaches to leveraging transformers to understand language expose one weak spot: Number understanding. In some scenarios, numbers frequently occur, especially in semi-structured data like tables. But current approaches to rich-number tasks with transformer-based language models abandon or lose some of the numeracy information - e.g., breaking numbers into sub-word tokens - which leads to many number-related errors. In this paper, we propose the LUNA framework which improves the numerical reasoning and calculation capabilities of transformer-based language models. With the number plugin of NumTok and NumBed, LUNA represents each number as a whole to model input. With number pre-training, including regression loss and model distillation, LUNA bridges the gap between number and vocabulary embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly injects numeracy capability into language models using Number Plugins. Besides evaluating toy models on toy tasks, we evaluate LUNA on three large-scale transformer models (RoBERTa, BERT, TabBERT) over three different downstream tasks (TATQA, TabFact, CrediTrans), and observe the performances of language models are constantly improved by LUNA. The augmented models also improve the official baseline of TAT-QA (EM: 50.15 -> 59.58) and achieve SOTA performance on CrediTrans (F1 = 86.17).

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformer has demonstrated great potential in abundant vision tasks. However, it also inevitably suffers from poor generalization capability when the distribution shift occurs in testing (i.e., out-of-distribution data). To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel method, Semantic-aware Message Broadcasting (SAMB), which enables more informative and flexible feature alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Particularly, we study the attention module in the vision transformer and notice that the alignment space using one global class token lacks enough flexibility, where it interacts information with all image tokens in the same manner but ignores the rich semantics of different regions. In this paper, we aim to improve the richness of the alignment features by enabling semantic-aware adaptive message broadcasting. Particularly, we introduce a group of learned group tokens as nodes to aggregate the global information from all image tokens, but encourage different group tokens to adaptively focus on the message broadcasting to different semantic regions. In this way, our message broadcasting encourages the group tokens to learn more informative and diverse information for effective domain alignment. Moreover, we systematically study the effects of adversarial-based feature alignment (ADA) and pseudo-label based self-training (PST) on UDA. We find that one simple two-stage training strategy with the cooperation of ADA and PST can further improve the adaptation capability of the vision transformer. Extensive experiments on DomainNet, OfficeHome, and VisDA-2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for UDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Geometry problem solving is a well-recognized testbed for evaluating the high-level multi-modal reasoning capability of deep models. In most existing works, two main geometry problems: calculation and proving, are usually treated as two specific tasks, hindering a deep model to unify its reasoning capability on multiple math tasks. However, in essence, these two tasks have similar problem representations and overlapped math knowledge which can improve the understanding and reasoning ability of a deep model on both two tasks. Therefore, we construct a large-scale Unified Geometry problem benchmark, UniGeo, which contains 4,998 calculation problems and 9,543 proving problems. Each proving problem is annotated with a multi-step proof with reasons and mathematical expressions. The proof can be easily reformulated as a proving sequence that shares the same formats with the annotated program sequence for calculation problems. Naturally, we also present a unified multi-task Geometric Transformer framework, Geoformer, to tackle calculation and proving problems simultaneously in the form of sequence generation, which finally shows the reasoning ability can be improved on both two tasks by unifying formulation. Furthermore, we propose a Mathematical Expression Pretraining (MEP) method that aims to predict the mathematical expressions in the problem solution, thus improving the Geoformer model. Experiments on the UniGeo demonstrate that our proposed Geoformer obtains state-of-the-art performance by outperforming task-specific model NGS with over 5.6% and 3.2% accuracies on calculation and proving problems, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a fundamental problem in numerous real-world applications. Recently, Transformer has become the de facto solution for MTSF, especially for the long-term cases. However, except for the one forward operation, the basic configurations in existing MTSF Transformer architectures were barely carefully verified. In this study, we point out that the current tokenization strategy in MTSF Transformer architectures ignores the token uniformity inductive bias of Transformers. Therefore, the vanilla MTSF transformer struggles to capture details in time series and presents inferior performance. Based on this observation, we make a series of evolution on the basic architecture of the vanilla MTSF transformer. We vary the flawed tokenization strategy, along with the decoder structure and embeddings. Surprisingly, the evolved simple transformer architecture is highly effective, which successfully avoids the over-smoothing phenomena in the vanilla MTSF transformer, achieves a more detailed and accurate prediction, and even substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformers that are well-designed for MTSF.

 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras, offering high temporal resolutions and high dynamic ranges, have brought a new perspective to address common challenges (e.g., motion blur and low light) in monocular depth estimation. However, how to effectively exploit the sparse spatial information and rich temporal cues from asynchronous events remains a challenging endeavor. To this end, we propose a novel event-based monocular depth estimator with recurrent transformers, namely EReFormer, which is the first pure transformer with a recursive mechanism to process continuous event streams. Technically, for spatial modeling, a novel transformer-based encoder-decoder with a spatial transformer fusion module is presented, having better global context information modeling capabilities than CNN-based methods. For temporal modeling, we design a gate recurrent vision transformer unit that introduces a recursive mechanism into transformers, improving temporal modeling capabilities while alleviating the expensive GPU memory cost. The experimental results show that our EReFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We hope that our work will attract further research to develop stunning transformers in the event-based vision community. Our open-source code can be found in the supplemental material.

 - **Abstract**
 Generative modeling of human motion has broad applications in computer animation, virtual reality, and robotics. Conventional approaches develop separate models for different motion synthesis tasks, and typically use a model of a small size to avoid overfitting the scarce data available in each setting. It remains an open question whether developing a single unified model is feasible, which may 1) benefit the acquirement of novel skills by combining skills learned from multiple tasks, and 2) help in increasing the model capacity without overfitting by combining multiple data sources. Unification is challenging because 1) it involves diverse control signals as well as targets of varying granularity, and 2) motion datasets may use different skeletons and default poses. In this paper, we present MoFusion, a framework for unified motion synthesis. MoFusion employs a Transformer backbone to ease the inclusion of diverse control signals via cross attention, and pretrains the backbone as a diffusion model to support multi-granularity synthesis ranging from motion completion of a body part to whole-body motion generation. It uses a learnable adapter to accommodate the differences between the default skeletons used by the pretraining and the fine-tuning data. Empirical results show that pretraining is vital for scaling the model size without overfitting, and demonstrate MoFusion's potential in various tasks, e.g., text-to-motion, motion completion, and zero-shot mixing of multiple control signals.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a new computer vision task named video object of interest segmentation (VOIS). Given a video and a target image of interest, our objective is to simultaneously segment and track all objects in the video that are relevant to the target image. This problem combines the traditional video object segmentation task with an additional image indicating the content that users are concerned with. Since no existing dataset is perfectly suitable for this new task, we specifically construct a large-scale dataset called LiveVideos, which contains 2418 pairs of target images and live videos with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose a transformer-based method for this task. We revisit Swin Transformer and design a dual-path structure to fuse video and image features. Then, a transformer decoder is employed to generate object proposals for segmentation and tracking from the fused features. Extensive experiments on LiveVideos dataset show the superiority of our proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional weather forecasting relies on domain expertise and computationally intensive numerical simulation systems. Recently, with the development of a data-driven approach, weather forecasting based on deep learning has been receiving attention. Deep learning-based weather forecasting has made stunning progress, from various backbone studies using CNN, RNN, and Transformer to training strategies using weather observations datasets with auxiliary inputs. All of this progress has contributed to the field of weather forecasting; however, many elements and complex structures of deep learning models prevent us from reaching physical interpretations. This paper proposes a SImple baseline with a spatiotemporal context Aggregation Network (SIANet) that achieved state-of-the-art in 4 parts of 5 benchmarks of W4C22. This simple but efficient structure uses only satellite images and CNNs in an end-to-end fashion without using a multi-model ensemble or fine-tuning. This simplicity of SIANet can be used as a solid baseline that can be easily applied in weather forecasting using deep learning.

 Small differences in a person's motion can engage drastically different muscles. While most visual representations of human activity are trained from video, people learn from multimodal experiences, including from the proprioception of their own muscles. We present a new visual perception task and dataset to model muscle activation in human activities from monocular video. Our Muscles in Action (MIA) dataset consists of 2 hours of synchronized video and surface electromyography (sEMG) data of subjects performing various exercises. Using this dataset, we learn visual representations that are predictive of muscle activation from monocular video. We present several models, including a transformer model, and measure their ability to generalize to new exercises and subjects. Putting muscles into computer vision systems will enable richer models of virtual humans, with applications in sports, fitness, and AR/VR.

 - **Abstract**
 Objective: We aim to develop an open-source natural language processing (NLP) package, SODA (i.e., SOcial DeterminAnts), with pre-trained transformer models to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) for cancer patients, examine the generalizability of SODA to a new disease domain (i.e., opioid use), and evaluate the extraction rate of SDoH using cancer populations. Methods: We identified SDoH categories and attributes and developed an SDoH corpus using clinical notes from a general cancer cohort. We compared four transformer-based NLP models to extract SDoH, examined the generalizability of NLP models to a cohort of patients prescribed with opioids, and explored customization strategies to improve performance. We applied the best NLP model to extract 19 categories of SDoH from the breast (n=7,971), lung (n=11,804), and colorectal cancer (n=6,240) cohorts. Results and Conclusion: We developed a corpus of 629 cancer patients notes with annotations of 13,193 SDoH concepts/attributes from 19 categories of SDoH. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model achieved the best strict/lenient F1 scores of 0.9216 and 0.9441 for SDoH concept extraction, 0.9617 and 0.9626 for linking attributes to SDoH concepts. Fine-tuning the NLP models using new annotations from opioid use patients improved the strict/lenient F1 scores from 0.8172/0.8502 to 0.8312/0.8679. The extraction rates among 19 categories of SDoH varied greatly, where 10 SDoH could be extracted from >70% of cancer patients, but 9 SDoH had a low extraction rate (<70% of cancer patients). The SODA package with pre-trained transformer models is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobiinformatics-lab/SDoH_SODA.

 - **Abstract**
 The task of automatic text summarization produces a concise and fluent text summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. Recent approaches to document-level summarization have seen significant improvements in recent years by using models based on the Transformer architecture. However, the quadratic memory and time complexities with respect to the sequence length make them very expensive to use, especially with long sequences, as required by document-level summarization. Our work addresses the problem of document-level summarization by studying how efficient Transformer techniques can be used to improve the automatic summarization of very long texts. In particular, we will use the arXiv dataset, consisting of several scientific papers and the corresponding abstracts, as baselines for this work. Then, we propose a novel retrieval-enhanced approach based on the architecture which reduces the cost of generating a summary of the entire document by processing smaller chunks. The results were below the baselines but suggest a more efficient memory a consumption and truthfulness.

 Hebrew is a Morphological rich language, making its modeling harder than simpler language. Recent developments such as Transformers in general and Bert in particular opened a path for Hebrew models that reach SOTA results, not falling short from other non-MRL languages. We explore the cutting edge in this field performing style transfer, text generation and classification over news articles collected from online archives. Furthermore, the news portals that feed our collective consciousness are an interesting corpus to study, as their analysis and tracing might reveal insights about our society and discourse.

 - **Abstract**
 Homography estimation is a basic computer vision task, which aims to obtain the transformation from multi-view images for image alignment. Unsupervised learning homography estimation trains a convolution neural network for feature extraction and transformation matrix regression. While the state-of-the-art homography method is based on convolution neural networks, few work focuses on transformer which shows superiority in high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong-baseline model based on the Swin Transformer, which combines convolution neural network for local features and transformer module for global features. Moreover, a cross non-local layer is introduced to search the matched features within the feature maps coarsely.In the homography regression stage, we adopts an attention layer for the channels of correlation volume, which can drop out some weak correlation feature points. The experiment shows that in 8 Degree-of-Freedoms(DOFs) homography estimation our methods overperform the state-of-the-art method.

 - **Abstract**
 Semantic segmentation usually benefits from global contexts, fine localisation information, multi-scale features, etc. To advance Transformer-based segmenters with these aspects, we present a simple yet powerful semantic segmentation architecture, termed as IncepFormer. IncepFormer has two critical contributions as following. First, it introduces a novel pyramid structured Transformer encoder which harvests global context and fine localisation features simultaneously. These features are concatenated and fed into a convolution layer for final per-pixel prediction. Second, IncepFormer integrates an Inception-like architecture with depth-wise convolutions, and a light-weight feed-forward module in each self-attention layer, efficiently obtaining rich local multi-scale object features. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our IncepFormer is superior to state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed, e.g., 1) our IncepFormer-S achieves 47.7% mIoU on ADE20K which outperforms the existing best method by 1% while only costs half parameters and fewer FLOPs. 2) Our IncepFormer-B finally achieves 82.0% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset with 39.6M parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances on text-to-image generation have witnessed the rise of diffusion models which act as powerful generative models. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous work on action representation learning focused on global representations for short video clips. In contrast, many practical applications, such as video alignment, strongly demand learning the intensive representation of long videos. In this paper, we introduce a new framework of contrastive action representation learning (CARL) to learn frame-wise action representation in a self-supervised or weakly-supervised manner, especially for long videos. Specifically, we introduce a simple but effective video encoder that considers both spatial and temporal context by combining convolution and transformer. Inspired by the recent massive progress in self-supervised learning, we propose a new sequence contrast loss (SCL) applied to two related views obtained by expanding a series of spatio-temporal data in two versions. One is the self-supervised version that optimizes embedding space by minimizing KL-divergence between sequence similarity of two augmented views and prior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. The other is the weakly-supervised version that builds more sample pairs among videos using video-level labels by dynamic time wrapping (DTW). Experiments on FineGym, PennAction, and Pouring datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for downstream fine-grained action classification and even faster inference. Surprisingly, although without training on paired videos like in previous works, our self-supervised version also shows outstanding performance in video alignment and fine-grained frame retrieval tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has explored the potential to adapt a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) by updating only a few parameters so as to improve storage efficiency, called parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL). Current PETL methods have shown that by tuning only 0.5% of the parameters, ViT can be adapted to downstream tasks with even better performance than full fine-tuning. In this paper, we aim to further promote the efficiency of PETL to meet the extreme storage constraint in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a tensorization-decomposition framework to store the weight increments, in which the weights of each ViT are tensorized into a single 3D tensor, and their increments are then decomposed into lightweight factors. In the fine-tuning process, only the factors need to be updated and stored, termed Factor-Tuning (FacT). On VTAB-1K benchmark, our method performs on par with NOAH, the state-of-the-art PETL method, while being 5x more parameter-efficient. We also present a tiny version that only uses 8K (0.01% of ViT's parameters) trainable parameters but outperforms full fine-tuning and many other PETL methods such as VPT and BitFit. In few-shot settings, FacT also beats all PETL baselines using the fewest parameters, demonstrating its strong capability in the low-data regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Vector-Quantized (VQ-based) generative models usually consist of two basic components, i.e., VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability of generative transformers. In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the generation. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives. In the first phase, we propose a semantic-enhanced perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase, we fix the encoder and codebook, but enhance and finetune the decoder to achieve better details preservation. The proposed SeQ-GAN greatly improves VQ-based generative models and surpasses the GAN and Diffusion Models on both unconditional and conditional image generation. Our SeQ-GAN (364M) achieves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on 256x256 ImageNet generation, a remarkable improvement over VIT-VQGAN (714M), which obtains 11.2 FID and 97.2 IS.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate features of a pre-trained model have been shown informative for making accurate predictions on downstream tasks, even if the model backbone is kept frozen. The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features given their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers. Through introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT leverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate features of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of downstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns to combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many other parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features and need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the complementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning. Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that utilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches that adapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints. Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higher accuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.

 - **Abstract**
 Representing relevant information of a traffic scene and understanding its environment is crucial for the success of autonomous driving. Modeling the surrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different traffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is hardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these relations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we model traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various different predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and deceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial semantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion results. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is improved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this explicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about previous scenes, we achieve 73% improvements.

 - **Abstract**
 As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in safety critical and privacy sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and biometric authentication, it is critical to understand the fault-tolerance nature of DNNs. Prior work primarily focuses on metrics such as Failures In Time (FIT) rate and the Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate, which quantify how often a device fails. Instead, this paper focuses on quantifying the DNN accuracy given that a transient error has occurred, which tells us how well a network behaves when a transient error occurs. We call this metric Resiliency Accuracy (RA). We show that existing RA formulation is fundamentally inaccurate, because it incorrectly assumes that software variables (model weights/activations) have equal faulty probability under hardware transient faults. We present an algorithm that captures the faulty probabilities of DNN variables under transient faults and, thus, provides correct RA estimations validated by hardware. To accelerate RA estimation, we reformulate RA calculation as a Monte Carlo integration problem, and solve it using importance sampling driven by DNN specific heuristics. Using our lightweight RA estimation method, we show that transient faults lead to far greater accuracy degradation than what todays DNN resiliency tools estimate. We show how our RA estimation tool can help design more resilient DNNs by integrating it with a Network Architecture Search framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual localization plays an important role for intelligent robots and autonomous driving, especially when the accuracy of GNSS is unreliable. Recently, camera localization in LiDAR maps has attracted more and more attention for its low cost and potential robustness to illumination and weather changes. However, the commonly used pinhole camera has a narrow Field-of-View, thus leading to limited information compared with the omni-directional LiDAR data. To overcome this limitation, we focus on correlating the information of 360 equirectangular images to point clouds, proposing an end-to-end learnable network to conduct cross-modal visual localization by establishing similarity in high-dimensional feature space. Inspired by the attention mechanism, we optimize the network to capture the salient feature for comparing images and point clouds. We construct several sequences containing 360 equirectangular images and corresponding point clouds based on the KITTI-360 dataset and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR-based 3D object detection is an indispensable task in advanced autonomous driving systems. Though impressive detection results have been achieved by superior 3D detectors, they suffer from significant performance degeneration when facing unseen domains, such as different LiDAR configurations, different cities, and weather conditions. The mainstream approaches tend to solve these challenges by leveraging unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these UDA solutions just yield unsatisfactory 3D detection results when there is a severe domain shift, e.g., from Waymo (64-beam) to nuScenes (32-beam). To address this, we present a novel Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation method for 3D object detection (SSDA3D), where only a few labeled target data is available, yet can significantly improve the adaptation performance. In particular, our SSDA3D includes an Inter-domain Adaptation stage and an Intra-domain Generalization stage. In the first stage, an Inter-domain Point-CutMix module is presented to efficiently align the point cloud distribution across domains. The Point-CutMix generates mixed samples of an intermediate domain, thus encouraging to learn domain-invariant knowledge. Then, in the second stage, we further enhance the model for better generalization on the unlabeled target set. This is achieved by exploring Intra-domain Point-MixUp in semi-supervised learning, which essentially regularizes the pseudo label distribution. Experiments from Waymo to nuScenes show that, with only 10% labeled target data, our SSDA3D can surpass the fully-supervised oracle model with 100% target label. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinjunbo/SSDA3D.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous cars are indispensable when humans go further down the hands-free route. Although existing literature highlights that the acceptance of the autonomous car will increase if it drives in a human-like manner, sparse research offers the naturalistic experience from a passenger's seat perspective to examine the human likeness of current autonomous cars. The present study tested whether the AI driver could create a human-like ride experience for passengers based on 69 participants' feedback in a real-road scenario. We designed a ride experience-based version of the non-verbal Turing test for automated driving. Participants rode in autonomous cars (driven by either human or AI drivers) as a passenger and judged whether the driver was human or AI. The AI driver failed to pass our test because passengers detected the AI driver above chance. In contrast, when the human driver drove the car, the passengers' judgement was around chance. We further investigated how human passengers ascribe humanness in our test. Based on Lewin's field theory, we advanced a computational model combining signal detection theory with pre-trained language models to predict passengers' humanness rating behaviour. We employed affective transition between pre-study baseline emotions and corresponding post-stage emotions as the signal strength of our model. Results showed that the passengers' ascription of humanness would increase with the greater affective transition. Our study suggested an important role of affective transition in passengers' ascription of humanness, which might become a future direction for autonomous driving.
