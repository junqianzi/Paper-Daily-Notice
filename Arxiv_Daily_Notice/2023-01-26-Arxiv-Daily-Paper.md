 - **Abstract**
 In simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), image feature point matching process consume a lot of time. The capacity of low-power systems such as embedded systems is almost limited. It is difficult to ensure the timely processing of each image information. To reduce time consuming when matching feature points in SLAM, an algorithm of using inertial measurement unit (IMU) to optimize the efficiency of image feature point matching is proposed. When matching two image feature points, the presented algorithm does not need to traverse the whole image for matching feature points, just around the predicted point within a small range traversal search to find matching feature points. After compared with the traditional algorithm, the experimental results show that this method has greatly reduced the consumption of image feature points matching time. All the conclusions will help research how to use the IMU optimize the efficiency of image feature point matching and improve the real-time performance in SLAM.

 - **Abstract**
 Most existing perception systems rely on sensory data acquired from cameras, which perform poorly in low light and adverse weather conditions. To resolve this limitation, we have witnessed advanced LiDAR sensors become popular in perception tasks in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, their usage in traffic monitoring systems is less ubiquitous. We identify two significant obstacles in cost-effectively and efficiently developing such a LiDAR-based traffic monitoring system: (i) public LiDAR datasets are insufficient for supporting perception tasks in infrastructure systems, and (ii) 3D annotations on LiDAR point clouds are time-consuming and expensive. To fill this gap, we present an efficient semi-automated annotation tool that automatically annotates LiDAR sequences with tracking algorithms while offering a fully annotated infrastructure LiDAR dataset -- FLORIDA (Florida LiDAR-based Object Recognition and Intelligent Data Annotation) -- which will be made publicly available. Our advanced annotation tool seamlessly integrates multi-object tracking (MOT), single-object tracking (SOT), and suitable trajectory post-processing techniques. Specifically, we introduce a human-in-the-loop schema in which annotators recursively fix and refine annotations imperfectly predicted by our tool and incrementally add them to the training dataset to obtain better SOT and MOT models. By repeating the process, we significantly increase the overall annotation speed by three to four times and obtain better qualitative annotations than a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The human annotation experiments verify the effectiveness of our annotation tool. In addition, we provide detailed statistics and object detection evaluation results for our dataset in serving as a benchmark for perception tasks at traffic intersections.

 - **Abstract**
 Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

 - **Abstract**
 [Context] Engineering Artificial Intelligence (AI) software is a relatively new area with many challenges, unknowns, and limited proven best practices. Big companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have provided a suite of recent guidelines to assist engineering teams in building human-centered AI systems. [Objective] The practices currently adopted by practitioners for developing such systems, especially during Requirements Engineering (RE), are little studied and reported to date. [Method] This paper presents the results of a survey conducted to understand current industry practices in RE for AI (RE4AI) and to determine which key human-centered AI guidelines should be followed. Our survey is based on mapping existing industrial guidelines, best practices, and efforts in the literature. [Results] We surveyed 29 professionals and found most participants agreed that all the human-centered aspects we mapped should be addressed in RE. Further, we found that most participants were using UML or Microsoft Office to present requirements. [Conclusion] We identify that most of the tools currently used are not equipped to manage AI-based software, and the use of UML and Office may pose issues to the quality of requirements captured for AI. Also, all human-centered practices mapped from the guidelines should be included in RE.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past few years, the widespread use of 3D printing technology enables the growth of the market of 3D printed products. On Esty, a website focused on handmade items, hundreds of individual entrepreneurs are selling their 3D printed products. Inspired by the positive effects of machine-readable tags, like barcodes, on daily product marketing, we propose AnisoTag, a novel tagging method to encode data on the 2D surface of 3D printed objects based on reflection anisotropy. AnisoTag has an unobtrusive appearance and much lower extraction computational complexity, contributing to a lightweight low-cost tagging system for individual entrepreneurs. On AnisoTag, data are encoded by the proposed tool as reflective anisotropic microstructures, which would reflect distinct illumination patterns when irradiating by collimated laser. Based on it, we implement a real-time detection prototype with inexpensive hardware to determine the reflected illumination pattern and decode data according to their mapping. We evaluate AnisoTag with various 3D printer brands, filaments, and printing parameters, demonstrating its superior usability, accessibility, and reliability for practical usage.

 - **Abstract**
 Exascale computing and its associated applications have required increasing degrees of efficiency. Semiconductor-Transistor-based Circuits (STbCs) have struggled with increasing the GHz frequency while dealing with power dissipation issues. Emerging as an alternative to STbC, single flux quantum (SFQ) logic in the superconducting electrons (SCE) technology promises higher-speed clock frequencies at ultra-low power consumption. However, its quantized pulse-based operation and high environmental requirements, process variations and other SFQ-specific non-idealities are the significant causes of logic error for SFQ circuits. A suitable method of minimizing the impact of the afore-mentioned error sources is to minimize the number of Josephson Junctions (JJs) in the circuits, hence an essential part of the design flow of large SFQ circuits. This paper presents a novel SFQ logic synthesis framework that given a netlist, offers an automated mapping solution including majority (MAJ) logic with the goal of minimizing the number of JJs, while catering to the unique characteristics and requirements of the design. Our experiments confirm that our synthesis framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art academic SFQ technology mapper, namely reducing the number of JJs on average by 35.0%.

 - **Abstract**
 Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are essential in providing localization and navigation services to most of the world due to their superior coverage. However, due to high pathloss and inevitable atmospheric effect, the positioning performance of any standalone GNSS is still poor in urban areas. To improve the positioning performance of legacy GNSSs in urban areas, a positioning system, which utilizes high altitude platform station (HAPS) and 5G gNodeBs (gNBs), in a futuristic urban vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) is proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gNBs in improving the vertical positioning accuracy for both the GPS-only system and the HAPS-aided GPS system by analyzing the impact of the density of gNBs and the pseudorange error of gNB on the positioning performance of the gNB augmented positioning systems. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) algorithms on the HAPS and/or gNB aided GPS systems in urban areas.

 - **Abstract**
 Local feature matching is essential for many applications, such as localization and 3D reconstruction. However, it is challenging to match feature points accurately in various camera viewpoints and illumination conditions. In this paper, we propose a framework that robustly extracts and describes salient local features regardless of changing light and viewpoints. The framework suppresses illumination variations and encourages structural information to ignore the noise from light and to focus on edges. We classify the elements in the feature covariance matrix, an implicit feature map information, into two components. Our model extracts feature points from salient regions leading to reduced incorrect matches. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in the public dataset, such as HPatches, Aachen Day-Night, and ETH, which especially show highly variant viewpoints and illumination.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, camera-based 3D object detection has gained widespread attention for its ability to achieve high performance with low computational cost. However, the robustness of these methods to adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the robustness of leading camera-based 3D object detection methods under various adversarial conditions. Our experiments reveal five interesting findings: (a) the use of accurate depth estimation effectively improves robustness; (b) depth-estimation-free approaches do not show superior robustness; (c) bird's-eye-view-based representations exhibit greater robustness against localization attacks; (d) incorporating multi-frame benign inputs can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks; and (e) addressing long-tail problems can enhance robustness. We hope our work can provide guidance for the design of future camera-based object detection modules with improved adversarial robustness.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents ViDeBERTa, a new pre-trained monolingual language model for Vietnamese, with three versions - ViDeBERTa_xsmall, ViDeBERTa_base, and ViDeBERTa_large, which are pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of high-quality and diverse Vietnamese texts using DeBERTa architecture. Although many successful pre-trained language models based on Transformer have been widely proposed for the English language, there are still few pre-trained models for Vietnamese, a low-resource language, that perform good results on downstream tasks, especially Question answering. We fine-tune and evaluate our model on three important natural language downstream tasks, Part-of-speech tagging, Named-entity recognition, and Question answering. The empirical results demonstrate that ViDeBERTa with far fewer parameters surpasses the previous state-of-the-art models on multiple Vietnamese-specific natural language understanding tasks. Notably, ViDeBERTa_base with 86M parameters, which is only about 23% of PhoBERT_large with 370M parameters, still performs the same or better results than the previous state-of-the-art model. Our ViDeBERTa models are available at: https://github.com/HySonLab/ViDeBERTa.

 - **Abstract**
 The full-scale conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine generated an unprecedented amount of news articles and social media data reflecting opposing ideologies and narratives. These polarized campaigns have led to mutual accusations of misinformation and fake news, shaping an atmosphere of confusion and mistrust for readers worldwide. This study analyses how the media affected and mirrored public opinion during the first month of the war using news articles and Telegram news channels in Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian and English. We propose and compare two methods of multilingual automated pro-Kremlin propaganda identification, based on Transformers and linguistic features. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, their adaptability to new genres and languages, and ethical considerations of their usage for content moderation. With this work, we aim to lay the foundation for further development of moderation tools tailored to the current conflict.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern artificial neural networks, including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, have mastered several computer vision tasks, including object recognition. However, there are many significant differences between the behavior and robustness of these systems and of the human visual system. Deep neural networks remain brittle and susceptible to many changes in the image that do not cause humans to misclassify images. Part of this different behavior may be explained by the type of features humans and deep neural networks use in vision tasks. Humans tend to classify objects according to their shape while deep neural networks seem to rely mostly on texture. Exploring this question is relevant, since it may lead to better performing neural network architectures and to a better understanding of the workings of the vision system of primates. In this work, we advance the state of the art in our understanding of this phenomenon, by extending previous analyses to a much larger set of deep neural network architectures. We found that the performance of models in image classification tasks is highly correlated with their shape bias measured at the output and penultimate layer. Furthermore, our results showed that the number of neurons that represent shape and texture are strongly anti-correlated, thus providing evidence that there is competition between these two types of features. Finally, we observed that while in general there is a correlation between performance and shape bias, there are significant variations between architecture families.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise load forecasting in buildings could increase the bill savings potential and facilitate optimized strategies for power generation planning. With the rapid evolution of computer science, data-driven techniques, in particular the Deep Learning models, have become a promising solution for the load forecasting problem. These models have showed accurate forecasting results; however, they need abundance amount of historical data to maintain the performance. Considering the new buildings and buildings with low resolution measuring equipment, it is difficult to get enough historical data from them, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to adapt Deep Learning models for buildings with limited and scarce data, this paper proposes a Building-to-Building Transfer Learning framework to overcome the problem and enhance the performance of Deep Learning models. The transfer learning approach was applied to a new technique known as Transformer model due to its efficacy in capturing data trends. The performance of the algorithm was tested on a large commercial building with limited data. The result showed that the proposed approach improved the forecasting accuracy by 56.8% compared to the case of conventional deep learning where training from scratch is used. The paper also compared the proposed Transformer model to other sequential deep learning models such as Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The accuracy of the transformer model outperformed other models by reducing the root mean square error to 0.009, compared to LSTM with 0.011 and RNN with 0.051.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing neural networks in terms of better-understood formal systems has the potential to yield new insights into the power and limitations of these networks. Doing so for transformers remains an active area of research. Bhattamishra and others have shown that transformer encoders are at least as expressive as a certain kind of counter machine, while Merrill and Sabharwal have shown that fixed-precision transformer encoders recognize only languages in uniform $TC^0$. We connect and strengthen these results by identifying a variant of first-order logic with counting quantifiers that is simultaneously an upper bound for fixed-precision transformer encoders and a lower bound for transformer encoders. This brings us much closer than before to an exact characterization of the languages that transformer encoders recognize.

 - **Abstract**
 The vision transformer (ViT) has advanced to the cutting edge in the visual recognition task. Transformers are more robust than CNN, according to the latest research. ViT's self-attention mechanism, according to the claim, makes it more robust than CNN. Even with this, we discover that these conclusions are based on unfair experimental conditions and just comparing a few models, which did not allow us to depict the entire scenario of robustness performance. In this study, we investigate the performance of 58 state-of-the-art computer vision models in a unified training setup based not only on attention and convolution mechanisms but also on neural networks based on a combination of convolution and attention mechanisms, sequence-based model, complementary search, and network-based method. Our research demonstrates that robustness depends on the training setup and model types, and performance varies based on out-of-distribution type. Our research will aid the community in better understanding and benchmarking the robustness of computer vision models.
