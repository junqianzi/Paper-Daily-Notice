 Global localization plays a critical role in many robot applications. LiDAR-based global localization draws the community's focus with its robustness against illumination and seasonal changes. To further improve the localization under large viewpoint differences, we propose RING++ which has roto-translation invariant representation for place recognition, and global convergence for both rotation and translation estimation. With the theoretical guarantee, RING++ is able to address the large viewpoint difference using a lightweight map with sparse scans. In addition, we derive sufficient conditions of feature extractors for the representation preserving the roto-translation invariance, making RING++ a framework applicable to generic multi-channel features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-free framework to address all subtasks of global localization in the sparse scan map. Validations on real-world datasets show that our approach demonstrates better performance than state-of-the-art learning-free methods, and competitive performance with learning-based methods. Finally, we integrate RING++ into a multi-robot/session SLAM system, performing its effectiveness in collaborative applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Object detection through LiDAR-based point cloud has recently been important in autonomous driving. Although achieving high accuracy on public benchmarks, the state-of-the-art detectors may still go wrong and cause a heavy loss due to the widespread corruptions in the real world like rain, snow, sensor noise, etc. Nevertheless, there is a lack of a large-scale dataset covering diverse scenes and realistic corruption types with different severities to develop practical and robust point cloud detectors, which is challenging due to the heavy collection costs. To alleviate the challenge and start the first step for robust point cloud detection, we propose the physical-aware simulation methods to generate degraded point clouds under different real-world common corruptions. Then, for the first attempt, we construct a benchmark based on the physical-aware common corruptions for point cloud detectors, which contains a total of 1,122,150 examples covering 7,481 scenes, 25 common corruption types, and 6 severities. With such a novel benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical studies on 8 state-of-the-art detectors that contain 6 different detection frameworks. Thus we get several insight observations revealing the vulnerabilities of the detectors and indicating the enhancement directions. Moreover, we further study the effectiveness of existing robustness enhancement methods based on data augmentation and data denoising. The benchmark can potentially be a new platform for evaluating point cloud detectors, opening a door for developing novel robustness enhancement methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel semantic model for human head defined with neural radiance field. The 3D-consistent head model consist of a set of disentangled and interpretable bases, and can be driven by low-dimensional expression coefficients. Thanks to the powerful representation ability of neural radiance field, the constructed model can represent complex facial attributes including hair, wearings, which can not be represented by traditional mesh blendshape. To construct the personalized semantic facial model, we propose to define the bases as several multi-level voxel fields. With a short monocular RGB video as input, our method can construct the subject's semantic facial NeRF model with only ten to twenty minutes, and can render a photo-realistic human head image in tens of miliseconds with a given expression coefficient and view direction. With this novel representation, we apply it to many tasks like facial retargeting and expression editing. Experimental results demonstrate its strong representation ability and training/inference speed.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714
 - **Abstract**
 Grounding language to the visual observations of a navigating agent can be performed using off-the-shelf visual-language models pretrained on Internet-scale data (e.g., image captions). While this is useful for matching images to natural language descriptions of object goals, it remains disjoint from the process of mapping the environment, so that it lacks the spatial precision of classic geometric maps. To address this problem, we propose VLMaps, a spatial map representation that directly fuses pretrained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world. VLMaps can be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration approaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional labeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence of open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial by construction, e.g., "in between the sofa and TV" or "three meters to the right of the chair") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared among multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps on-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments carried out in simulated and real world environments show that VLMaps enable navigation according to more complex language instructions than existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of mapping an ambiguous entity mention to the corresponding entry in a structured knowledge base. Previous research showed that entity overshadowing is a significant challenge for existing ED models: when presented with an ambiguous entity mention, the models are much more likely to rank a more frequent yet less contextually relevant entity at the top. Here, we present NICE, an iterative approach that uses entity type information to leverage context and avoid over-relying on the frequency-based prior. Our experiments show that NICE achieves the best performance results on the overshadowed entities while still performing competitively on the frequent entities.

 - **Abstract**
 Tensor programs often need to process large tensors (vectors, matrices, or higher order tensors) that require a specialized storage format for their memory layout. Several such layouts have been proposed in the literature, such as the Coordinate Format, the Compressed Sparse Row format, and many others, that were especially designed to optimally store tensors with specific sparsity properties. However, existing tensor processing systems require specialized extensions in order to take advantage of every new storage format. In this paper we describe a system that allows users to define flexible storage formats in a declarative tensor query language, similar to the language used by the tensor program. The programmer only needs to write storage mappings, which describe, in a declarative way, how the tensors are laid out in main memory. Then, we describe a cost-based optimizer that optimizes the tensor program for the specific memory layout. We demonstrate empirically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art tensor processing systems.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06366
 - **Abstract**
 Panoptic segmentation assigns semantic and instance ID labels to every pixel of an image. As permutations of instance IDs are also valid solutions, the task requires learning of high-dimensional one-to-many mapping. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches use customized architectures and task-specific loss functions. We formulate panoptic segmentation as a discrete data generation problem, without relying on inductive bias of the task. A diffusion model based on analog bits is used to model panoptic masks, with a simple, generic architecture and loss function. By simply adding past predictions as a conditioning signal, our method is capable of modeling video (in a streaming setting) and thereby learns to track object instances automatically. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our generalist approach can perform competitively to state-of-the-art specialist methods in similar settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired neural networks with asynchronous discrete and sparse characteristics, which have increasingly manifested their superiority in low energy consumption. Recent research is devoted to utilizing spatio-temporal information to directly train SNNs by backpropagation. However, the binary and non-differentiable properties of spike activities force directly trained SNNs to suffer from serious gradient vanishing and network degradation, which greatly limits the performance of directly trained SNNs and prevents them from going deeper. In this paper, we propose a multi-level firing (MLF) method based on the existing spatio-temporal back propagation (STBP) method, and spiking dormant-suppressed residual network (spiking DS-ResNet). MLF enables more efficient gradient propagation and the incremental expression ability of the neurons. Spiking DS-ResNet can efficiently perform identity mapping of discrete spikes, as well as provide a more suitable connection for gradient propagation in deep SNNs. With the proposed method, our model achieves superior performances on a non-neuromorphic dataset and two neuromorphic datasets with much fewer trainable parameters and demonstrates the great ability to combat the gradient vanishing and degradation problem in deep SNNs.

### Distance Map Supervised Landmark Localization for MR-TRUS Registration

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05738
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05738
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose to explicitly use the landmarks of prostate to guide the MR-TRUS image registration. We first train a deep neural network to automatically localize a set of meaningful landmarks, and then directly generate the affine registration matrix from the location of these landmarks. For landmark localization, instead of directly training a network to predict the landmark coordinates, we propose to regress a full-resolution distance map of the landmark, which is demonstrated effective in avoiding statistical bias to unsatisfactory performance and thus improving performance. We then use the predicted landmarks to generate the affine transformation matrix, which outperforms the clinicians' manual rigid registration by a significant margin in terms of TRE.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems are becoming increasingly popular for indoor localization, where range measurements are obtained by measuring the time-of-flight of radio signals. However, the range measurements typically suffer from a systematic error or bias that must be corrected for high-accuracy localization. In this paper, a ranging protocol is proposed alongside a robust and scalable antenna-delay calibration procedure to accurately and efficiently calibrate antenna delays for many UWB tags. Additionally, the bias and uncertainty of the measurements are modelled as a function of the received-signal power. The full calibration procedure is presented using experimental training data of 3 aerial robots fitted with 2 UWB tags each, and then evaluated on 2 test experiments. A localization problem is then formulated on the experimental test data, and the calibrated measurements and their modelled uncertainty are fed into an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed calibration is shown to yield an average of 46% improvement in localization accuracy. Lastly, the paper is accompanied by an open-source UWB-calibration Python library, which can be found at https://github.com/decarsg/uwb_calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, deep learning-based methods have drawn huge attention due to their simple yet high performance without domain knowledge in sound classification and localization tasks. However, a lack of gun sounds in existing datasets has been a major obstacle to implementing a support system to spot criminals from their gunshots by leveraging deep learning models. Since the occurrence of gunshot is rare and unpredictable, it is impractical to collect gun sounds in the real world. As an alternative, gun sounds can be obtained from an FPS game that is designed to mimic real-world warfare. The recent FPS game offers a realistic environment where we can safely collect gunshot data while simulating even dangerous situations. By exploiting the advantage of the game environment, we construct a gunshot dataset, namely BGG, for the firearm classification and gunshot localization tasks. The BGG dataset consists of 37 different types of firearms, distances, and directions between the sound source and a receiver. We carefully verify that the in-game gunshot data has sufficient information to identify the location and type of gunshots by training several sound classification and localization baselines on the BGG dataset. Afterward, we demonstrate that the accuracy of real-world firearm classification and localization tasks can be enhanced by utilizing the BGG dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the pose of a pallet and other logistics objects is crucial for various use cases, such as automatized material handling or tracking. Innovations in computer vision, computing power, and machine learning open up new opportunities for device-free localization based on cameras and neural networks. Large image datasets with annotated poses are required for training the network. Manual annotation, especially of 6D poses, is an extremely labor-intensive process. Hence, newer approaches often leverage synthetic training data to automatize the process of generating annotated image datasets. In this work, the generation of synthetic training data for 6D pose estimation of pallets is presented. The data is then used to train the Deep Object Pose Estimation (DOPE) algorithm. The experimental validation of the algorithm proves that the 6D pose estimation of a standardized Euro pallet with a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera is feasible. The comparison of the results from three varying datasets under different lighting conditions shows the relevance of an appropriate dataset design to achieve an accurate and robust localization. The quantitative evaluation shows an average position error of less than 20 cm for the preferred dataset. The validated training dataset and a photorealistic model of a Euro pallet are publicly provided.
### ViewBirdiformer: Learning to recover ground-plane crowd trajectories and  ego-motion from a single ego-centric view

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06332
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel learning-based method for view birdification, the task of recovering ground-plane trajectories of pedestrians of a crowd and their observer in the same crowd just from the observed ego-centric video. View birdification becomes essential for mobile robot navigation and localization in dense crowds where the static background is hard to see and reliably track. It is challenging mainly for two reasons; i) absolute trajectories of pedestrians are entangled with the movement of the observer which needs to be decoupled from their observed relative movements in the ego-centric video, and ii) a crowd motion model describing the pedestrian movement interactions is specific to the scene yet unknown a priori. For this, we introduce a Transformer-based network referred to as ViewBirdiformer which implicitly models the crowd motion through self-attention and decomposes relative 2D movement observations onto the ground-plane trajectories of the crowd and the camera through cross-attention between views. Most important, ViewBirdiformer achieves view birdification in a single forward pass which opens the door to accurate real-time, always-on situational awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ViewBirdiformer achieves accuracy similar to or better than state-of-the-art with three orders of magnitude reduction in execution time.
### Improving information retention in large scale online continual learning

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06401
 - **Abstract**
 Given a stream of data sampled from non-stationary distributions, online continual learning (OCL) aims to adapt efficiently to new data while retaining existing knowledge. The typical approach to address information retention (the ability to retain previous knowledge) is keeping a replay buffer of a fixed size and computing gradients using a mixture of new data and the replay buffer. Surprisingly, the recent work (Cai et al., 2021) suggests that information retention remains a problem in large scale OCL even when the replay buffer is unlimited, i.e., the gradients are computed using all past data. This paper focuses on this peculiarity to understand and address information retention. To pinpoint the source of this problem, we theoretically show that, given limited computation budgets at each time step, even without strict storage limit, naively applying SGD with constant or constantly decreasing learning rates fails to optimize information retention in the long term. We propose using a moving average family of methods to improve optimization for non-stationary objectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive moving average (AMA) optimizer and a moving-average-based learning rate schedule (MALR). We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMA+MALR on large-scale benchmarks, including Continual Localization (CLOC), Google Landmarks, and ImageNet. Code will be released upon publication.

### Transformers generalize differently from information stored in context  vs in weights

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05675
 - **Abstract**
 Transformer models can use two fundamentally different kinds of information: information stored in weights during training, and information provided ``in-context'' at inference time. In this work, we show that transformers exhibit different inductive biases in how they represent and generalize from the information in these two sources. In particular, we characterize whether they generalize via parsimonious rules (rule-based generalization) or via direct comparison with observed examples (exemplar-based generalization). This is of important practical consequence, as it informs whether to encode information in weights or in context, depending on how we want models to use that information. In transformers trained on controlled stimuli, we find that generalization from weights is more rule-based whereas generalization from context is largely exemplar-based. In contrast, we find that in transformers pre-trained on natural language, in-context learning is significantly rule-based, with larger models showing more rule-basedness. We hypothesise that rule-based generalization from in-context information might be an emergent consequence of large-scale training on language, which has sparse rule-like structure. Using controlled stimuli, we verify that transformers pretrained on data containing sparse rule-like structure exhibit more rule-based generalization.
### Shapley Head Pruning: Identifying and Removing Interference in  Multilingual Transformers

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05709
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05709
 - **Abstract**
 Multilingual transformer-based models demonstrate remarkable zero and few-shot transfer across languages by learning and reusing language-agnostic features. However, as a fixed-size model acquires more languages, its performance across all languages degrades, a phenomenon termed interference. Often attributed to limited model capacity, interference is commonly addressed by adding additional parameters despite evidence that transformer-based models are overparameterized. In this work, we show that it is possible to reduce interference by instead identifying and pruning language-specific parameters. First, we use Shapley Values, a credit allocation metric from coalitional game theory, to identify attention heads that introduce interference. Then, we show that removing identified attention heads from a fixed model improves performance for a target language on both sentence classification and structural prediction, seeing gains as large as 24.7\%. Finally, we provide insights on language-agnostic and language-specific attention heads using attention visualization.
### Curved Representation Space of Vision Transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Neural networks with self-attention (a.k.a. Transformers) like ViT and Swin have emerged as a better alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. However, our understanding of how the new architecture works is still limited. In this paper, we focus on the phenomenon that Transformers show higher robustness against corruptions than CNNs, while not being overconfident (in fact, we find Transformers are actually underconfident). This is contrary to the intuition that robustness increases with confidence. We resolve this contradiction by investigating how the output of the penultimate layer moves in the representation space as the input data moves within a small area. In particular, we show the following. (1) While CNNs exhibit fairly linear relationship between the input and output movements, Transformers show nonlinear relationship for some data. For those data, the output of Transformers moves in a curved trajectory as the input moves linearly. (2) When a data is located in a curved region, it is hard to move it out of the decision region since the output moves along a curved trajectory instead of a straight line to the decision boundary, resulting in high robustness of Transformers. (3) If a data is slightly modified to jump out of the curved region, the movements afterwards become linear and the output goes to the decision boundary directly. Thus, Transformers can be attacked easily after a small random jump and the perturbation in the final attacked data remains imperceptible, i.e., there does exist a decision boundary near the data. This also explains the underconfident prediction of Transformers. (4) The curved regions in the representation space start to form at an early training stage and grow throughout the training course. Some data are trapped in the regions, obstructing Transformers from reducing the training loss.
### Streaming Punctuation for Long-form Dictation with Transformers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05756
 - **Abstract**
 While speech recognition Word Error Rate (WER) has reached human parity for English, long-form dictation scenarios still suffer from segmentation and punctuation problems resulting from irregular pausing patterns or slow speakers. Transformer sequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context, which is crucial for automatic punctuation. A typical Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) production system, however, is constrained by real-time requirements, making it hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions. In this paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation of ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on punctuation and segmentation accuracy in a variety of scenarios. The new system tackles over-segmentation issues, improving segmentation F0.5-score by 13.9%. Streaming punctuation achieves an average BLEU-score gain of 0.66 for the downstream task of Machine Translation (MT).
### Scaling Up Deliberation for Multilingual ASR

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05785
 - **Abstract**
 Multilingual end-to-end automatic speech recognition models are attractive due to its simplicity in training and deployment. Recent work on large-scale training of such models has shown promising results compared to monolingual models. However, the work often focuses on multilingual models themselves in a single-pass setup. In this work, we investigate second-pass deliberation for multilingual speech recognition. Our proposed deliberation is multilingual, i.e., the text encoder encodes hypothesis text from multiple languages, and the decoder attends to multilingual text and audio. We investigate scaling the deliberation text encoder and decoder, and compare scaling the deliberation decoder and the first-pass cascaded encoder. We show that deliberation improves the average WER on 9 languages by 4% relative compared to the single-pass model. By increasing the size of the deliberation up to 1B parameters, the average WER improvement increases to 9%, with up to 14% for certain languages. Our deliberation rescorer is based on transformer layers and can be parallelized during rescoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in Transformer architecture have empowered its empirical success in various tasks across different domains. However, existing works mainly focus on improving the standard accuracy and computational cost, without considering the robustness of contaminated samples. Existing work has shown that the self-attention mechanism, which is the center of the Transformer architecture, can be viewed as a non-parametric estimator based on the well-known kernel density estimation (KDE). This motivates us to leverage the robust kernel density estimation (RKDE) in the self-attention mechanism, to alleviate the issue of the contamination of data by down-weighting the weight of bad samples in the estimation process. The modified self-attention mechanism can be incorporated into different Transformer variants. Empirical results on language modeling and image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a unified model for multiple conditional video synthesis tasks, including video prediction and video frame interpolation. We show that conditional video synthesis can be formulated as a neural process, which maps input spatio-temporal coordinates to target pixel values given context spatio-temporal coordinates and pixels values. Specifically, we feed an implicit neural representations of coordinates into a Transformer-based non-autoregressive conditional video synthesis model. Our task-specific models outperform previous work for video interpolation on multiple datasets and reach a competitive performance with the state-of-the-art models for video prediction. Importantly, the model is able to interpolate or predict with an arbitrary high frame rate, i.e., continuous synthesis. Our source code is available at \url{https://github.com/NPVS/NPVS}.

 - **Abstract**
 While vision transformers have achieved impressive results, effectively and efficiently accelerating these models can further boost performances. In this work, we propose a dense/sparse training framework to obtain a unified model, enabling weight sharing across various token densities. Thus one model offers a range of accuracy and throughput tradeoffs for different applications. Besides, we introduce adaptive token pruning to optimize the patch token sparsity based on the input image. In addition, we investigate knowledge distillation to enhance token selection capability in early transformer modules. Sparse adaptive image Transformer (SaiT) offers varying levels of model acceleration by merely changing the token sparsity on the fly. Specifically, SaiT reduces the computation complexity (FLOPs) by 39% - 43% and increases the throughput by 67% - 91% with less than 0.5% accuracy loss for various vision transformer models. Meanwhile, the same model also provides the zero accuracy drop option by skipping the sparsification step. SaiT achieves better accuracy and computation tradeoffs than state-of-the-art transformer and convolutional models.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of Transformers, large language models (LLMs) have saturated well-known NLP benchmarks and leaderboards with high aggregate performance. However, many times these models systematically fail on tail data or rare groups not obvious in aggregate evaluation. Identifying such problematic data groups is even more challenging when there are no explicit labels (e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc.) and further compounded for NLP datasets due to the lack of visual features to characterize failure modes (e.g., Asian males, animals indoors, waterbirds on land, etc.). This paper introduces an interactive Systematic Error Analysis and Labeling (\seal) tool that uses a two-step approach to first identify high error slices of data and then, in the second step, introduce methods to give human-understandable semantics to those underperforming slices. We explore a variety of methods for coming up with coherent semantics for the error groups using language models for semantic labeling and a text-to-image model for generating visual features.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the capability of plain Vision Transformers (ViTs) for semantic segmentation and propose the SegVit. Previous ViT-based segmentation networks usually learn a pixel-level representation from the output of the ViT. Differently, we make use of the fundamental component -- attention mechanism, to generate masks for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module, in which the similarity maps between a set of learnable class tokens and the spatial feature maps are transferred to the segmentation masks. Experiments show that our proposed SegVit using the ATM module outperforms its counterparts using the plain ViT backbone on the ADE20K dataset and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on COCO-Stuff-10K and PASCAL-Context datasets. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost of the ViT backbone, we propose query-based down-sampling (QD) and query-based up-sampling (QU) to build a Shrunk structure. With the proposed Shrunk structure, the model can save up to $40\%$ computations while maintaining competitive performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dynamics from visual observations is a challenging problem that requires disentangling individual objects from the scene and learning their interactions. While recent object-centric models can successfully decompose a scene into objects, modeling their dynamics effectively still remains a challenge. We address this problem by introducing SlotFormer -- a Transformer-based autoregressive model operating on learned object-centric representations. Given a video clip, our approach reasons over object features to model spatio-temporal relationships and predicts accurate future object states. In this paper, we successfully apply SlotFormer to perform video prediction on datasets with complex object interactions. Moreover, the unsupervised SlotFormer's dynamics model can be used to improve the performance on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), and goal-conditioned planning. Compared to past works on dynamics modeling, our method achieves significantly better long-term synthesis of object dynamics, while retaining high quality visual generation. Besides, SlotFormer enables VQA models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is competitive with methods designed specifically for such tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Coded/uncoded content placement in Mobile Edge Caching (MEC) has evolved as an efficient solution to meet the significant growth of global mobile data traffic by boosting the content diversity in the storage of caching nodes. To meet the dynamic nature of the historical request pattern of multimedia contents, the main focus of recent researches has been shifted to develop data-driven and real-time caching schemes. In this regard and with the assumption that users' preferences remain unchanged over a short horizon, the Top-K popular contents are identified as the output of the learning model. Most existing datadriven popularity prediction models, however, are not suitable for the coded/uncoded content placement frameworks. On the one hand, in coded/uncoded content placement, in addition to classifying contents into two groups, i.e., popular and nonpopular, the probability of content request is required to identify which content should be stored partially/completely, where this information is not provided by existing data-driven popularity prediction models. On the other hand, the assumption that users' preferences remain unchanged over a short horizon only works for content with a smooth request pattern. To tackle these challenges, we develop a Multiple-model (hybrid) Transformer-based Edge Caching (MTEC) framework with higher generalization ability, suitable for various types of content with different time-varying behavior, that can be adapted with coded/uncoded content placement frameworks. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed MTEC caching framework in comparison to its counterparts in terms of the cache-hit ratio, classification accuracy, and the transferred byte volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the ability of self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) to represent pixel-level semantic relationships promotes the development of unsupervised dense prediction tasks. In this work, we investigate transferring self-supervised ViT to unsupervised semantic segmentation task. According to the analysis that the pixel-level representations of self-supervised ViT within a single image achieve good intra-class compactness and inter-class discrimination, we propose the Dynamic Clustering Network (DCN) to dynamically infer the underlying cluster centers for different images. By training with the proposed modularity loss, the DCN learns to project a set of prototypes to cluster centers for pixel representations in each image and assign pixels to different clusters, resulting on dividing each image to class-agnostic regions. For achieving unsupervised semantic segmentation task, we treat it as a region classification problem. Based on the regions produced by the DCN, we explore different ways to extract region-level representations and classify them in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method trough experiments on unsupervised semantic segmentation, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 unsupervised semantic segmentation task.

 - **Abstract**
 The image inpainting task fills missing areas of a corrupted image. Despite impressive results have been achieved recently, it is still challenging to restore corrupted images with both vivid textures and reasonable structures. Some previous methods only tackle regular textures while losing holistic structures limited by receptive fields of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an improved model over our conference ZITS model. Specifically, given one corrupt image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. Further, to well recover image texture details, we take the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) module, which has both the Fourier and large-kernel attention convolutions. Typically, FTR can be independently pre-trained without image structural priors. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE), and updating the FTR by a novel incremental training strategy of Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA). Essentially, a new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular masks. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate the efficacy of our model compared with other competitors. We also conduct extensive ablation to compare and verify various priors for image inpainting tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Automated machine learning has been widely explored to reduce human efforts in designing neural architectures and looking for proper hyperparameters. In the domain of neural initialization, however, similar automated techniques have rarely been studied. Most existing initialization methods are handcrafted and highly dependent on specific architectures. In this paper, we propose a differentiable quantity, named GradCosine, with theoretical insights to evaluate the initial state of a neural network. Specifically, GradCosine is the cosine similarity of sample-wise gradients with respect to the initialized parameters. By analyzing the sample-wise optimization landscape, we show that both the training and test performance of a network can be improved by maximizing GradCosine under gradient norm constraint. Based on this observation, we further propose the neural initialization optimization (NIO) algorithm. Generalized from the sample-wise analysis into the real batch setting, NIO is able to automatically look for a better initialization with negligible cost compared with the training time. With NIO, we improve the classification performance of a variety of neural architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Moreover, we find that our method can even help to train large vision Transformer architecture without warmup.
### Bridging the Gap Between Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural  Networks on Small Datasets

 - **Abstract**
 There still remains an extreme performance gap between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when training from scratch on small datasets, which is concluded to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we further consider this problem and point out two weaknesses of ViTs in inductive biases, that is, the spatial relevance and diverse channel representation. First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and relevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its neighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance. Second, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different channels. But the scarce data can not enable ViTs to learn strong enough representation for accurate recognition. To this end, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Vision Transformer (DHVT) as the solution to enhance the two inductive biases. On spatial aspect, we adopt a hybrid structure, in which convolution is integrated into patch embedding and multi-layer perceptron module, forcing the model to capture the token features as well as their neighboring features. On channel aspect, we introduce a dynamic feature aggregation module in MLP and a brand new "head token" design in multi-head self-attention module to help re-calibrate channel representation and make different channel group representation interacts with each other. The fusion of weak channel representation forms a strong enough representation for classification. With this design, we successfully eliminate the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, and our DHVT achieves a series of state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight model, 85.68% on CIFAR-100 with 22.8M parameters, 82.3% on ImageNet-1K with 24.0M parameters.

### Human Joint Kinematics Diffusion-Refinement for Stochastic Motion  Prediction

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple plausible future motions given a single pose sequence from the past. Most previous works focus on designing elaborate losses to improve the accuracy, while the diversity is typically characterized by randomly sampling a set of latent variables from the latent prior, which is then decoded into possible motions. This joint training of sampling and decoding, however, suffers from posterior collapse as the learned latent variables tend to be ignored by a strong decoder, leading to limited diversity. Alternatively, inspired by the diffusion process in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we propose MotionDiff, a diffusion probabilistic model to treat the kinematics of human joints as heated particles, which will diffuse from original states to a noise distribution. This process offers a natural way to obtain the "whitened" latents without any trainable parameters, and human motion prediction can be regarded as the reverse diffusion process that converts the noise distribution into realistic future motions conditioned on the observed sequence. Specifically, MotionDiff consists of two parts: a spatial-temporal transformer-based diffusion network to generate diverse yet plausible motions, and a graph convolutional network to further refine the outputs. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our model yields the competitive performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 Anticipating future actions in a video is useful for many autonomous and assistive technologies. Prior action anticipation work mostly treats this as a vision modality problem, where the models learn the task information primarily from the video features in the target action anticipation datasets. In this work, we propose a method to make use of the text-modality that is available during the training, to bring in complementary information that is not present in the target action anticipation datasets. In particular, we leverage pre-trained language models to build a text-modality teacher that is able to predict future actions based on text labels of the past actions extracted from the input video. To further adapt the teacher to the target domain (cooking), we also pretrain the teacher on textual instructions from a recipes dataset (Recipe1M). Then, we distill the knowledge gained by the text-modality teacher into a vision-modality student to further improve it's performance. We empirically evaluate this simple cross-modal distillation strategy on two video datasets EGTEA-GAZE+ and EPIC-KITCHEN 55. Distilling this text-modality knowledge into a strong vision model (Anticipative Vision Transformer) yields consistent gains across both datasets, 3.5% relative improvement on top1 class mean recall for EGTEA-GAZE+, 7.2% on top5 many-shot class mean recall for EPIC-KITCHEN 55 and achieves new state-of-the-results.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, 3D lane detection has been an actively developing area in autonomous driving which is the key to routing the vehicle. This work proposes a deployment-oriented monocular 3D lane detector with only naive CNN and FC layers. This detector achieved state-of-the-art results on the Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic dataset and OpenLane real-world dataset with 96 FPS runtime speed. We conduct three techniques in our detector: (1) Virtual Camera eliminates the difference in poses of cameras mounted on different vehicles. (2) Spatial Feature Pyramid Transform as a light-weighed image-view to bird-eye view transformer can utilize scales of image-view featmaps. (3) Yolo Style Lane Representation makes a good balance between bird-eye view resolution and runtime speed. Meanwhile, it can reduce the inefficiency caused by the class imbalance due to the sparsity of the lane detection task during training. Combining these three techniques, we obtained a 58.4% F1-score on the OpenLane dataset, which is a 10.6% improvement over the baseline. On the Apollo dataset, we achieved an F1-score of 96.9%, which is 4% points of supremacy over the best on the leaderboard. The source code will release soon.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a model that generates a drum track in the audio domain to play along to a user-provided drum-free recording. Specifically, using paired data of drumless tracks and the corresponding human-made drum tracks, we train a Transformer model to improvise the drum part of an unseen drumless recording. We combine two approaches to encode the input audio. First, we train a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent the input audio with discrete codes, which can then be readily used in a Transformer. Second, using an audio-domain beat tracking model, we compute beat-related features of the input audio and use them as embeddings in the Transformer. Instead of generating the drum track directly as waveforms, we use a separate VQ-VAE to encode the mel-spectrogram of a drum track into another set of discrete codes, and train the Transformer to predict the sequence of drum-related discrete codes. The output codes are then converted to a mel-spectrogram with a decoder, and then to the waveform with a vocoder. We report both objective and subjective evaluations of variants of the proposed model, demonstrating that the model with beat information generates drum accompaniment that is rhythmically and stylistically consistent with the input audio.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-autoregressive machine translation (NAT) has recently made great progress. However, most works to date have focused on standard translation tasks, even though some edit-based NAT models, such as the Levenshtein Transformer (LevT), seem well suited to translate with a Translation Memory (TM). This is the scenario considered here. We first analyze the vanilla LevT model and explain why it does not do well in this setting. We then propose a new variant, TM-LevT, and show how to effectively train this model. By modifying the data presentation and introducing an extra deletion operation, we obtain performance that are on par with an autoregressive approach, while reducing the decoding load. We also show that incorporating TMs during training dispenses to use knowledge distillation, a well-known trick used to mitigate the multimodality issue.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale video-language pre-training has shown significant improvement in video-language understanding tasks. Previous studies of video-language pretraining mainly focus on short-form videos (i.e., within 30 seconds) and sentences, leaving long-form video-language pre-training rarely explored. Directly learning representation from long-form videos and language may benefit many long-form video-language understanding tasks. However, it is challenging due to the difficulty of modeling long-range relationships and the heavy computational burden caused by more frames. In this paper, we introduce a Long-Form VIdeo-LAnguage pre-training model (LF-VILA) and train it on a large-scale long-form video and paragraph dataset constructed from an existing public dataset. To effectively capture the rich temporal dynamics and to better align video and language in an efficient end-to-end manner, we introduce two novel designs in our LF-VILA model. We first propose a Multimodal Temporal Contrastive (MTC) loss to learn the temporal relation across different modalities by encouraging fine-grained alignment between long-form videos and paragraphs. Second, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal Window Attention (HTWA) mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependency while reducing computational cost in Transformer. We fine-tune the pre-trained LF-VILA model on seven downstream long-form video-language understanding tasks of paragraph-to-video retrieval and long-form video question-answering, and achieve new state-of-the-art performances. Specifically, our model achieves 16.1% relative improvement on ActivityNet paragraph-to-video retrieval task and 2.4% on How2QA task, respectively. We release our code, dataset, and pre-trained models at https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain.

 - **Abstract**
 The state-of-the-art for monocular 3D human pose estimation in videos is dominated by the paradigm of 2D-to-3D pose uplifting. While the uplifting methods themselves are rather efficient, the true computational complexity depends on the per-frame 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based pose uplifting scheme that can operate on temporally sparse 2D pose sequences but still produce temporally dense 3D pose estimates. We show how masked token modeling can be utilized for temporal upsampling within Transformer blocks. This allows to decouple the sampling rate of input 2D poses and the target frame rate of the video and drastically decreases the total computational complexity. Additionally, we explore the option of pre-training on large motion capture archives, which has been largely neglected so far. We evaluate our method on two popular benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. With an MPJPE of 45.0 mm and 46.9 mm, respectively, our proposed method can compete with the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by a factor of 12. This enables real-time throughput with variable consumer hardware in stationary and mobile applications. We release our code and models at https://github.com/goldbricklemon/uplift-upsample-3dhpe

 Translation suggestion (TS) models are used to automatically provide alternative suggestions for incorrect spans in sentences generated by machine translation. This paper introduces the system used in our submission to the WMT'22 Translation Suggestion shared task. Our system is based on the ensemble of different translation architectures, including Transformer, SA-Transformer, and DynamicConv. We use three strategies to construct synthetic data from parallel corpora to compensate for the lack of supervised data. In addition, we introduce a multi-phase pre-training strategy, adding an additional pre-training phase with in-domain data. We rank second and third on the English-German and English-Chinese bidirectional tasks, respectively.

 Recent years have witnessed the rise and success of pre-training techniques in visually-rich document understanding. However, most existing methods lack the systematic mining and utilization of layout-centered knowledge, leading to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-Layout, a novel document pre-training solution with layout knowledge enhancement in the whole workflow, to learn better representations that combine the features from text, layout, and image. Specifically, we first rearrange input sequences in the serialization stage, and then present a correlative pre-training task, reading order prediction, to learn the proper reading order of documents. To improve the layout awareness of the model, we integrate a spatial-aware disentangled attention into the multi-modal transformer and a replaced regions prediction task into the pre-training phase. Experimental results show that ERNIE-Layout achieves superior performance on various downstream tasks, setting new state-of-the-art on key information extraction, document image classification, and document question answering datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative for sharing knowledge while adhering to restrictive data access regulations, e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Mainstream state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are composed of a generator and a discriminator. While convolution neural networks are shown to be a better architecture than fully connected networks for tabular data synthesizing, two key properties of tabular data are overlooked: (i) the global correlation across columns, and (ii) invariant synthesizing to column permutations of input data. To address the above problems, we propose a Fourier conditional tabular generative adversarial network (FCT-GAN). We introduce feature tokenization and Fourier networks to construct a transformer-style generator and discriminator, and capture both local and global dependencies across columns. The tokenizer captures local spatial features and transforms original data into tokens. Fourier networks transform tokens to frequency domains and element-wisely multiply a learnable filter. Extensive evaluation on benchmarks and real-world data shows that FCT-GAN can synthesize tabular data with high machine learning utility (up to 27.8% better than state-of-the-art baselines) and high statistical similarity to the original data (up to 26.5% better), while maintaining the global correlation across columns, especially on high dimensional dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Tabular data is among the oldest and most ubiquitous forms of data. However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics still remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across many real-world data sets with heterogeneous feature types.

 - **Abstract**
 Context representation is crucial to both dialogue understanding and generation. Recently, the most popular method for dialog context representation is to concatenate the last-$k$ previous utterances as context and use a large transformer-based model to generate the next response. However, this method may not be ideal for conversations containing long-range dependencies. In this work, we propose DialoGX, a novel encoder-decoder based framework for conversational response generation with a generalized and explainable context representation that can look beyond the last-$k$ utterances. Hence the method is adaptive to conversations with long-range dependencies. Our proposed solution is based on two key ideas: a) computing a dynamic representation of the entire context, and b) finding the previous utterances that are relevant for generating the next response. Instead of last-$k$ utterances, DialoGX uses the concatenation of the dynamic context vector and encoding of the most relevant utterances as input which enables it to represent conversations of any length in a compact and generalized fashion. We conduct our experiments on DailyDialog, a popular open-domain chit-chat dataset. DialoGX achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models on the automated metrics. We also justify our context representation through the lens of psycholinguistics and show that the relevance score of previous utterances agrees well with human cognition which makes DialoGX explainable as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic generation of high-quality Chinese fonts from a few online training samples is a challenging task, especially when the amount of samples is very small. Existing few-shot font generation methods can only synthesize low-resolution glyph images that often possess incorrect topological structures or/and incomplete strokes. To address the problem, this paper proposes FontTransformer, a novel few-shot learning model, for high-resolution Chinese glyph image synthesis by using stacked Transformers. The key idea is to apply the parallel Transformer to avoid the accumulation of prediction errors and utilize the serial Transformer to enhance the quality of synthesized strokes. Meanwhile, we also design a novel encoding scheme to feed more glyph information and prior knowledge to our model, which further enables the generation of high-resolution and visually-pleasing glyph images. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other existing approaches in the few-shot Chinese font synthesis task.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper studies the curious phenomenon for machine learning models with Transformer architectures that their activation maps are sparse. By activation map we refer to the intermediate output of the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) after a ReLU activation function, and by "sparse" we mean that on average very few entries (e.g., 3.0% for T5-Base and 6.3% for ViT-B16) are nonzero for each input to MLP. Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels, as well as for other architectures including MLP-mixers and 2-layer MLPs. We show that sparsity also emerges using training datasets with random labels, or with random inputs, or with infinite amount of data, demonstrating that sparsity is not a result of a specific family of datasets. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers. Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser activation via Top-k thresholding with a small value of k brings a collection of desired but missing properties for Transformers, namely less sensitivity to noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better calibration for their prediction confidence.

 - **Abstract**
 Amodal Instance Segmentation (AIS) aims to segment the region of both visible and possible occluded parts of an object instance. While Mask R-CNN-based AIS approaches have shown promising results, they are unable to model high-level features coherence due to the limited receptive field. The most recent transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we present AISFormer, an AIS framework, with a Transformer-based mask head. AISFormer explicitly models the complex coherence between occluder, visible, amodal, and invisible masks within an object's regions of interest by treating them as learnable queries. Specifically, AISFormer contains four modules: (i) feature encoding: extract ROI and learn both short-range and long-range visual features. (ii) mask transformer decoding: generate the occluder, visible, and amodal mask query embeddings by a transformer decoder (iii) invisible mask embedding: model the coherence between the amodal and visible masks, and (iv) mask predicting: estimate output masks including occluder, visible, amodal and invisible. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on three challenging benchmarks i.e. KINS, D2SA, and COCOA-cls to evaluate the effectiveness of AISFormer.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel learning-based method for view birdification, the task of recovering ground-plane trajectories of pedestrians of a crowd and their observer in the same crowd just from the observed ego-centric video. View birdification becomes essential for mobile robot navigation and localization in dense crowds where the static background is hard to see and reliably track. It is challenging mainly for two reasons; i) absolute trajectories of pedestrians are entangled with the movement of the observer which needs to be decoupled from their observed relative movements in the ego-centric video, and ii) a crowd motion model describing the pedestrian movement interactions is specific to the scene yet unknown a priori. For this, we introduce a Transformer-based network referred to as ViewBirdiformer which implicitly models the crowd motion through self-attention and decomposes relative 2D movement observations onto the ground-plane trajectories of the crowd and the camera through cross-attention between views. Most important, ViewBirdiformer achieves view birdification in a single forward pass which opens the door to accurate real-time, always-on situational awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ViewBirdiformer achieves accuracy similar to or better than state-of-the-art with three orders of magnitude reduction in execution time.

 - **Abstract**
 Well-designed diagnostic tasks have played a key role in studying the failure of neural nets (NNs) to generalize systematically. Famous examples include SCAN and Compositional Table Lookup (CTL). Here we introduce CTL++, a new diagnostic dataset based on compositions of unary symbolic functions. While the original CTL is used to test length generalization or productivity, CTL++ is designed to test systematicity of NNs, that is, their capability to generalize to unseen compositions of known functions. CTL++ splits functions into groups and tests performance on group elements composed in a way not seen during training. We show that recent CTL-solving Transformer variants fail on CTL++. The simplicity of the task design allows for fine-grained control of task difficulty, as well as many insightful analyses. For example, we measure how much overlap between groups is needed by tested NNs for learning to compose. We also visualize how learned symbol representations in outputs of functions from different groups are compatible in case of success but not in case of failure. These results provide insights into failure cases reported on more complex compositions in the natural language domain. Our code is public.

 - **Abstract**
 Large neural network models are commonly trained through a combination of advanced parallelism strategies in a single program, multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. For example, training large transformer models requires combining data, model, and pipeline partitioning; and optimizer sharding techniques. However, identifying efficient combinations for many model architectures and accelerator systems requires significant manual analysis. In this work, we present an automatic partitioner that identifies these combinations through a goal-oriented search. Our key findings are that a Monte Carlo Tree Search-based partitioner leveraging partition-specific compiler analysis directly into the search and guided goals matches expert-level strategies for various models.

 - **Abstract**
 Because of its importance in studying people's thoughts on various Web 2.0 services, emotion classification (EC) is an important undertaking. Existing research, on the other hand, is mostly focused on the English language, with little work on low-resource languages. Though sentiment analysis, particularly the EC in English, has received a lot of attention in recent years, little study has been done in the context of Bangla, one of the world's most widely spoken languages. We propose a complete set of approaches for identifying and extracting emotions from Bangla texts in this research. We provide a Bangla emotion classifier for six classes (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) from Bangla words, using transformer-based models which exhibit phenomenal results in recent days, especially for high resource languages. The "Unified Bangla Multi-class Emotion Corpus (UBMEC)" is used to assess the performance of our models. UBMEC was created by combining two previously released manually labeled datasets of Bangla comments on 6-emotion classes with fresh manually tagged Bangla comments created by us. The corpus dataset and code we used in this work is publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 A big convergence of model architectures across language, vision, speech, and multimodal is emerging. However, under the same name "Transformers", the above areas use different implementations for better performance, e.g., Post-LayerNorm for BERT, and Pre-LayerNorm for GPT and vision Transformers. We call for the development of Foundation Transformer for true general-purpose modeling, which serves as a go-to architecture for various tasks and modalities with guaranteed training stability. In this work, we introduce a Transformer variant, named Magneto, to fulfill the goal. Specifically, we propose Sub-LayerNorm for good expressivity, and the initialization strategy theoretically derived from DeepNet for stable scaling up. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance and better stability than the de facto Transformer variants designed for various applications, including language modeling (i.e., BERT, and GPT), machine translation, vision pretraining (i.e., BEiT), speech recognition, and multimodal pretraining (i.e., BEiT-3).
### Token-Label Alignment for Vision Transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Data mixing strategies (e.g., CutMix) have shown the ability to greatly improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They mix two images as inputs for training and assign them with a mixed label with the same ratio. While they are shown effective for vision transformers (ViTs), we identify a token fluctuation phenomenon that has suppressed the potential of data mixing strategies. We empirically observe that the contributions of input tokens fluctuate as forward propagating, which might induce a different mixing ratio in the output tokens. The training target computed by the original data mixing strategy can thus be inaccurate, resulting in less effective training. To address this, we propose a token-label alignment (TL-Align) method to trace the correspondence between transformed tokens and the original tokens to maintain a label for each token. We reuse the computed attention at each layer for efficient token-label alignment, introducing only negligible additional training costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the performance of ViTs on image classification, semantic segmentation, objective detection, and transfer learning tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 In reasoning about sequential events it is natural to pose probabilistic queries such as "when will event A occur next" or "what is the probability of A occurring before B", with applications in areas such as user modeling, medicine, and finance. However, with machine learning shifting towards neural autoregressive models such as RNNs and transformers, probabilistic querying has been largely restricted to simple cases such as next-event prediction. This is in part due to the fact that future querying involves marginalization over large path spaces, which is not straightforward to do efficiently in such models. In this paper we introduce a general typology for predictive queries in neural autoregressive sequence models and show that such queries can be systematically represented by sets of elementary building blocks. We leverage this typology to develop new query estimation methods based on beam search, importance sampling, and hybrids. Across four large-scale sequence datasets from different application domains, as well as for the GPT-2 language model, we demonstrate the ability to make query answering tractable for arbitrary queries in exponentially-large predictive path-spaces, and find clear differences in cost-accuracy tradeoffs between search and sampling methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation is an important task in 3D computer vision, which is widely applied in autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Current large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually use down-sampling operations to improve computation efficiency and acquire point clouds with multi-resolution. However, this may cause the problem of missing local information. Meanwhile, it is difficult for networks to capture global information in large-scale distributed contexts. To capture local and global information effectively, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network called LACV-Net for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. The proposed network contains three main components: 1) a local adaptive feature augmentation module (LAFA) to adaptively learn the similarity of centroids and neighboring points to augment the local context; 2) a comprehensive VLAD module (C-VLAD) that fuses local features with multi-layer, multi-scale, and multi-resolution to represent a comprehensive global description vector; and 3) an aggregation loss function to effectively optimize the segmentation boundaries by constraining the adaptive weight from the LAFA module. Compared to state-of-the-art networks on several large-scale benchmark datasets, including S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed network.

 - **Abstract**
 Object detection through LiDAR-based point cloud has recently been important in autonomous driving. Although achieving high accuracy on public benchmarks, the state-of-the-art detectors may still go wrong and cause a heavy loss due to the widespread corruptions in the real world like rain, snow, sensor noise, etc. Nevertheless, there is a lack of a large-scale dataset covering diverse scenes and realistic corruption types with different severities to develop practical and robust point cloud detectors, which is challenging due to the heavy collection costs. To alleviate the challenge and start the first step for robust point cloud detection, we propose the physical-aware simulation methods to generate degraded point clouds under different real-world common corruptions. Then, for the first attempt, we construct a benchmark based on the physical-aware common corruptions for point cloud detectors, which contains a total of 1,122,150 examples covering 7,481 scenes, 25 common corruption types, and 6 severities. With such a novel benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical studies on 8 state-of-the-art detectors that contain 6 different detection frameworks. Thus we get several insight observations revealing the vulnerabilities of the detectors and indicating the enhancement directions. Moreover, we further study the effectiveness of existing robustness enhancement methods based on data augmentation and data denoising. The benchmark can potentially be a new platform for evaluating point cloud detectors, opening a door for developing novel robustness enhancement methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, 3D lane detection has been an actively developing area in autonomous driving which is the key to routing the vehicle. This work proposes a deployment-oriented monocular 3D lane detector with only naive CNN and FC layers. This detector achieved state-of-the-art results on the Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic dataset and OpenLane real-world dataset with 96 FPS runtime speed. We conduct three techniques in our detector: (1) Virtual Camera eliminates the difference in poses of cameras mounted on different vehicles. (2) Spatial Feature Pyramid Transform as a light-weighed image-view to bird-eye view transformer can utilize scales of image-view featmaps. (3) Yolo Style Lane Representation makes a good balance between bird-eye view resolution and runtime speed. Meanwhile, it can reduce the inefficiency caused by the class imbalance due to the sparsity of the lane detection task during training. Combining these three techniques, we obtained a 58.4% F1-score on the OpenLane dataset, which is a 10.6% improvement over the baseline. On the Apollo dataset, we achieved an F1-score of 96.9%, which is 4% points of supremacy over the best on the leaderboard. The source code will release soon.
### Hierarchical Instance Mixing across Domains in Aerial Segmentation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the task of unsupervised domain adaptation in aerial semantic segmentation and discover that the current state-of-the-art algorithms designed for autonomous driving based on domain mixing do not translate well to the aerial setting. This is due to two factors: (i) a large disparity in the extension of the semantic categories, which causes a domain imbalance in the mixed image, and (ii) a weaker structural consistency in aerial scenes than in driving scenes since the same scene might be viewed from different perspectives and there is no well-defined and repeatable structure of the semantic elements in the images. Our solution to these problems is composed of: (i) a new mixing strategy for aerial segmentation across domains called Hierarchical Instance Mixing (HIMix), which extracts a set of connected components from each semantic mask and mixes them according to a semantic hierarchy and, (ii) a twin-head architecture in which two separate segmentation heads are fed with variations of the same images in a contrastive fashion to produce finer segmentation maps. We conduct extensive experiments on the LoveDA benchmark, where our solution outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
