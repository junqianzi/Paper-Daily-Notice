 - **Abstract**
 This paper demonstrates a visual SLAM system that utilizes point and line cloud for robust camera localization, simultaneously, with an embedded piece-wise planar reconstruction (PPR) module which in all provides a structural map. To build a scale consistent map in parallel with tracking, such as employing a single camera brings the challenge of reconstructing geometric primitives with scale ambiguity, and further introduces the difficulty in graph optimization of bundle adjustment (BA). We address these problems by proposing several run-time optimizations on the reconstructed lines and planes. The system is then extended with depth and stereo sensors based on the design of the monocular framework. The results show that our proposed SLAM tightly incorporates the semantic features to boost both frontend tracking as well as backend optimization. We evaluate our system exhaustively on various datasets, and open-source our code for the community (https://github.com/PeterFWS/Structure-PLP-SLAM).

 - **Abstract**
 Serverless computing paradigm has become more ingrained into the industry, as it offers a cheap alternative for application development and deployment. This new paradigm has also created new kinds of problems for the developer, who needs to tune memory configurations for balancing cost and performance. Many researchers have addressed the issue of minimizing cost and meeting Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements for a single FaaS function, but there has been a gap for solving the same problem for an application consisting of many FaaS functions, creating complex application workflows. In this work, we designed a tool called SLAM to address the issue. SLAM uses distributed tracing to detect the relationship among the FaaS functions within a serverless application. By modeling each of them, it estimates the execution time for the application at different memory configurations. Using these estimations, SLAM determines the optimal memory configuration for the given serverless application based on the specified SLO requirements and user-specified objectives (minimum cost or minimum execution time). We demonstrate the functionality of SLAM on AWS Lambda by testing on four applications. Our results show that the suggested memory configurations guarantee that more than 95% of requests are completed within the predefined SLOs.

 - **Abstract**
 Point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted attentions due to its robustness to light condition. This makes it an ideal semantic solution for autonomous driving. However, considering the large computation burden and bandwidth demanding of neural networks, putting all the computing into vehicle Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is not efficient or practical. In this paper, we proposed a light weighted point cloud semantic segmentation network based on range view. Due to its simple pre-processing and standard convolution, it is efficient when running on deep learning accelerator like DPU. Furthermore, a near sensor computing system is built for autonomous vehicles. In this system, a FPGA-based deep learning accelerator core (DPU) is placed next to the LiDAR sensor, to perform point cloud pre-processing and segmentation neural network. By leaving only the post-processing step to ECU, this solution heavily alleviate the computation burden of ECU and consequently shortens the decision making and vehicles reaction latency. Our semantic segmentation network achieved 10 frame per second (fps) on Xilinx DPU with computation efficiency 42.5 GOP/W.

 - **Abstract**
 Depth estimation is one of the key technologies in some fields such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, the traditional method of using a single sensor is inevitably limited by the performance of the sensor. Therefore, a precision and robust method for fusing the LiDAR and stereo cameras is proposed. This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and stereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the LiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the traditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting conditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the LiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the density of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted disparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method. Secondly, in order to make full use of the precise disparity map, the disparity map and stereo matching are fused to propagate the accurate disparity. Finally, the disparity map is converted to the depth map. Moreover, the converted disparity map can also increase the speed of the algorithm. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on the KITTI benchmark. The experiment demonstrates that our algorithm has higher accuracy than several classic methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Supervised learning depth estimation methods can achieve good performance when trained on high-quality ground-truth, like LiDAR data. However, LiDAR can only generate sparse 3D maps which causes losing information. Obtaining high-quality ground-truth depth data per pixel is difficult to acquire. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach combining structure information from a promising Plane and Parallax geometry pipeline with depth information into a U-Net supervised learning network, which results in quantitative and qualitative improvement compared to existing popular learning-based methods. In particular, the model is evaluated on two large-scale and challenging datasets: KITTI Vision Benchmark and Cityscapes dataset and achieve the best performance in terms of relative error. Compared with pure depth supervision models, our model has impressive performance on depth prediction of thin objects and edges, and compared to structure prediction baseline, our model performs more robustly.

 - **Abstract**
 The use of crowdsourced data has been finding practical use for enhancing situational awareness during disasters. While recent studies have shown promising results regarding the potential of crowdsourced data for flood mapping, little attention has been paid to data imbalances issues that could introduce biases. We examine biases present in crowdsourced reports to identify data imbalances with a goal of improving disaster situational awareness. Sample bias, spatial bias, and demographic bias are examined as we analyzed reported flooding from 3-1-1, Waze reports, and FEMA damage data collected in the aftermaths of Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019 and Hurricane Ida in 2021. Integrating other flooding related topics from 3-1-1 reports into the Global Moran's I and Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) test revealed more communities that were impacted by floods. To examine spatial bias, we perform the LISA and BI-LISA tests on the three datasets at the census tract and census block group level. By looking at two geographical aggregations, we found that the larger spatial aggregations, census tracts, show less data imbalance in the results. Finally, one-way analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test performed on the clusters generated from the BI-LISA shows that data imbalance exists in areas where minority populations reside. Through a regression analysis, we found that 3-1-1 and Waze reports have data imbalance limitations in areas where minority populations reside. The findings of this study advance understanding of data imbalances and biases in crowdsourced datasets that are growingly used for disaster situational awareness.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper focuses on designing a noise-robust end-to-end Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) system. To this end, we propose Visual Context-driven Audio Feature Enhancement module (V-CAFE) to enhance the input noisy audio speech with a help of audio-visual correspondence. The proposed V-CAFE is designed to capture the transition of lip movements, namely visual context and to generate a noise reduction mask by considering the obtained visual context. Through context-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be refined for mask generation. The noisy representations are masked out with the noise reduction mask resulting in enhanced audio features. The enhanced audio features are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder model composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the proposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the noise-robustness of AVSR. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in noisy speech recognition and overlapped speech recognition experiments using the two largest audio-visual datasets, LRS2 and LRS3.

 - **Abstract**
 Some recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of single-stage neural text-to-speech, which does not need to generate mel-spectrograms but generates the raw waveforms directly from the text. Single-stage text-to-speech often faces two problems: a) the one-to-many mapping problem due to multiple speech variations and b) insufficiency of high frequency reconstruction due to the lack of supervision of ground-truth acoustic features during training. To solve the a) problem and generate more expressive speech, we propose a novel phoneme-level prosody modeling method based on a variational autoencoder with normalizing flows to model underlying prosodic information in speech. We also use the prosody predictor to support end-to-end expressive speech synthesis. Furthermore, we propose the dual parallel autoencoder to introduce supervision of the ground-truth acoustic features during training to solve the b) problem enabling our model to generate high-quality speech. We compare the synthesis quality with state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems on an internal expressive English dataset. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method for lossless speech generation while also showing a strong capability in prosody modeling.
### Learnability Enhancement for Low-light Raw Denoising: Where Paired Real  Data Meets Noise Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Low-light raw denoising is an important and valuable task in computational photography where learning-based methods trained with paired real data are mainstream. However, the limited data volume and complicated noise distribution have constituted a learnability bottleneck for paired real data, which limits the denoising performance of learning-based methods. To address this issue, we present a learnability enhancement strategy to reform paired real data according to noise modeling. Our strategy consists of two efficient techniques: shot noise augmentation (SNA) and dark shading correction (DSC). Through noise model decoupling, SNA improves the precision of data mapping by increasing the data volume and DSC reduces the complexity of data mapping by reducing the noise complexity. Extensive results on the public datasets and real imaging scenarios collectively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06205
 - **Abstract**
 Humans have an innate ability to sense their surroundings, as they can extract the spatial representation from the egocentric perception and form an allocentric semantic map via spatial transformation and memory updating. However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map. In contrast, Trans4Map achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing 67.2% parameters, yet gaining a +3.25% mIoU and a +4.09% mBF1 improvements on the Matterport3D dataset. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jamycheung/Trans4Map.
### PyMAF-X: Towards Well-aligned Full-body Model Regression from Monocular  Images

 - **Abstract**
 Regression-based methods can estimate body, hand, and even full-body models from monocular images by directly mapping raw pixels to the model parameters in a feed-forward manner. However, minor deviation in parameters may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated meshes and input images, especially in the context of full-body mesh recovery. To address this issue, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it to PyMAF-X for the recovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidences will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the alignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide mesh-image correspondence guidance while a spatial alignment attention is introduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When extending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy is proposed in PyMAF-X to adjust the elbow-twist rotations, which produces natural wrist poses while maintaining the well-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets for body-only and full-body mesh recovery, where PyMAF and PyMAF-X effectively improve the mesh-image alignment and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

 - **Abstract**
 Abnormality, defined as any abnormal feature in the system, may occur in different areas such as healthcare, medicine, cyber security, industry, etc. The detection and localization of the abnormality have been studied widely in wireless sensor networks literature where the sensors use electromagnetic waves for communication. Due to their invasiveness, bio-incompatibility, and high energy consumption for some applications, molecular communication (MC) has been introduced as an alternative approach, which enables promising systems for abnormality detection and localization. In this paper, we overview the MC-based abnormality detection and localization schemes. To do this, we propose a general MC system for abnormality detection and localization to encompass the most related works. The general MC-based abnormality detection and localization system consists of multiple tiers for sensing the abnormality and communication between different agents in the system. We describe different abnormality recognition methods, which can be used by the sensors to obtain information about the abnormality. Further, we describe the functional units of the sensors and different sensor features. We explain different interfaces for connecting the internal and external communication networks and generally model the sensing and communication channels. We formulate the abnormality detection and localization problem using MC systems and present a general framework for the externally-controllable localization systems. We categorize the MC-based abnormality detection schemes based on the sensor mobility, cooperative detection, and cooperative sensing/activation. We classify the localization approaches based on the sensor mobility and propulsion mechanisms. Finally, we provide the ongoing challenges and future research directions to realize and develop MC-based systems for detection and localization of the abnormality.

To build a scale consistent map in parallel with tracking, such as employing a single camera brings the challenge of reconstructing geometric primitives with scale ambiguity, and further introduces the difficulty in graph optimization of bundle adjustment (BA). We address these problems by proposing several run-time optimizations on the reconstructed lines and planes. The system is then extended with depth and stereo sensors based on the design of the monocular framework. The results show that our proposed SLAM tightly incorporates the semantic features to boost both frontend tracking as well as backend optimization. We evaluate our system exhaustively on various datasets, and open-source our code for the community (https://github.com/PeterFWS/Structure-PLP-SLAM).

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06333
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06333
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel method to reliably estimate the pose of a camera given a sequence of images acquired in extreme environments such as deep seas or extraterrestrial terrains. Data acquired under these challenging conditions are corrupted by textureless surfaces, image degradation, and presence of repetitive and highly ambiguous structures. When naively deployed, the state-of-the-art methods can fail in those scenarios as confirmed by our empirical analysis. In this paper, we attempt to make camera relocalization work in these extreme situations. To this end, we propose: (i) a hierarchical localization system, where we leverage temporal information and (ii) a novel environment-aware image enhancement method to boost the robustness and accuracy. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in favor of our method under two extreme settings: localizing an autonomous underwater vehicle and localizing a planetary rover in a Mars-like desert. In addition, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods on the indoor benchmark (7-Scenes dataset) using only 20% training data.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a parametric variational autoencoder-based human target detection and localization framework working directly with the raw analog-to-digital converter data from the frequency modulated continous wave radar. We propose a parametrically constrained variational autoencoder, with residual and skip connections, capable of generating the clustered and localized target detections on the range-angle image. Furthermore, to circumvent the problem of training the proposed neural network on all possible scenarios using real radar data, we propose domain adaptation strategies whereby we first train the neural network using ray tracing based model data and then adapt the network to work on real sensor data. This strategy ensures better generalization and scalability of the proposed neural network even though it is trained with limited radar data. We demonstrate the superior detection and localization performance of our proposed solution compared to the conventional signal processing pipeline and earlier state-of-art deep U-Net architecture with range-doppler images as inputs

 - **Abstract**
 Pathologists have a rich vocabulary with which they can describe all the nuances of cellular morphology. In their world, there is a natural pairing of images and words. Recent advances demonstrate that machine learning models can now be trained to learn high-quality image features and represent them as discrete units of information. This enables natural language, which is also discrete, to be jointly modelled alongside the imaging, resulting in a description of the contents of the imaging. Here we present experiments in applying discrete modelling techniques to the problem domain of non-melanoma skin cancer, specifically, histological images of Intraepidermal Carcinoma (IEC). Implementing a VQ-GAN model to reconstruct high-resolution (256x256) images of IEC images, we trained a sequence-to-sequence transformer to generate natural language descriptions using pathologist terminology. Combined with the idea of interactive concept vectors available by using continuous generative methods, we demonstrate an additional angle of interpretability. The result is a promising means of working towards highly expressive machine learning systems which are not only useful as predictive/classification tools, but also means to further our scientific understanding of disease.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying spans in medical texts that correspond to medical entities is one of the core steps for many healthcare NLP tasks such as ICD coding, medical finding extraction, medical note contextualization, to name a few. Existing entity extraction methods rely on a fixed and limited vocabulary of medical entities and have difficulty with extracting entities represented by disjoint spans. In this paper, we present a new transformer-based architecture called OSLAT, Open Set Label Attention Transformer, that addresses many of the limitations of the previous methods. Our approach uses the label-attention mechanism to implicitly learn spans associated with entities of interest. These entities can be provided as free text, including entities not seen during OSLAT's training, and the model can extract spans even when they are disjoint. To test the generalizability of our method, we train two separate models on two different datasets, which have very low entity overlap: (1) a public discharge notes dataset from hNLP, and (2) a much more challenging proprietary patient text dataset "Reasons for Encounter" (RFE). We find that OSLAT models trained on either dataset outperform rule-based and fuzzy string matching baselines when applied to the RFE dataset as well as to the portion of hNLP dataset where entities are represented by disjoint spans. Our code can be found at https://github.com/curai/curai-research/tree/main/OSLAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventionally, Earth system (e.g., weather and climate) forecasting relies on numerical simulation with complex physical models and are hence both expensive in computation and demanding on domain expertise. With the explosive growth of the spatiotemporal Earth observation data in the past decade, data-driven models that apply Deep Learning (DL) are demonstrating impressive potential for various Earth system forecasting tasks. The Transformer as an emerging DL architecture, despite its broad success in other domains, has limited adoption in this area. In this paper, we propose Earthformer, a space-time Transformer for Earth system forecasting. Earthformer is based on a generic, flexible and efficient space-time attention block, named Cuboid Attention. The idea is to decompose the data into cuboids and apply cuboid-level self-attention in parallel. These cuboids are further connected with a collection of global vectors. We conduct experiments on the MovingMNIST dataset and a newly proposed chaotic N-body MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of cuboid attention and figure out the best design of Earthformer. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks about precipitation nowcasting and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasting show Earthformer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of travel time estimation is widely considered as the fundamental challenge of modern logistics. The complex nature of interconnections between spatial aspects of roads and temporal dynamics of ground transport still preserves an area to experiment with. However, the total volume of currently accumulated data encourages the construction of the learning models which have the perspective to significantly outperform earlier solutions. In order to address the problems of travel time estimation, we propose a new method based on transformer architecture - TransTTE.

 - **Abstract**
 Generalizing machine learning (ML) models for network traffic dynamics tends to be considered a lost cause. Hence, for every new task, we often resolve to design new models and train them on model-specific datasets collected, whenever possible, in an environment mimicking the model's deployment. This approach essentially gives up on generalization. Yet, an ML architecture called_Transformer_ has enabled previously unimaginable generalization in other domains. Nowadays, one can download a model pre-trained on massive datasets and only fine-tune it for a specific task and context with comparatively little time and data. These fine-tuned models are now state-of-the-art for many benchmarks. We believe this progress could translate to networking and propose a Network Traffic Transformer (NTT), a transformer adapted to learn network dynamics from packet traces. Our initial results are promising: NTT seems able to generalize to new prediction tasks and contexts. This study suggests there is still hope for generalization, though it calls for a lot of future research.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing sports performance or preventing injuries requires capturing ground reaction forces (GRFs) exerted by the human body during certain movements. Standard practice uses physical markers paired with force plates in a controlled environment, but this is marred by high costs, lengthy implementation time, and variance in repeat experiments; hence, we propose GRF inference from video. While recent work has used LSTMs to estimate GRFs from 2D viewpoints, these can be limited in their modeling and representation capacity. First, we propose using a transformer architecture to tackle the GRF from video task, being the first to do so. Then we introduce a new loss to minimize high impact peaks in regressed curves. We also show that pre-training and multi-task learning on 2D-to-3D human pose estimation improves generalization to unseen motions. And pre-training on this different task provides good initial weights when finetuning on smaller (rarer) GRF datasets. We evaluate on LAAS Parkour and a newly collected ForcePose dataset; we show up to 19% decrease in error compared to prior approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing keyframe-based motion synthesis mainly focuses on the generation of cyclic actions or short-term motion, such as walking, running, and transitions between close postures. However, these methods will significantly degrade the naturalness and diversity of the synthesized motion when dealing with complex and impromptu movements, e.g., dance performance and martial arts. In addition, current research lacks fine-grained control over the generated motion, which is essential for intelligent human-computer interaction and animation creation. In this paper, we propose a novel keyframe-based motion generation network based on multiple constraints, which can achieve diverse dance synthesis via learned knowledge. Specifically, the algorithm is mainly formulated based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the Transformer architecture. The backbone of our network is a hierarchical RNN module composed of two long short-term memory (LSTM) units, in which the first LSTM is utilized to embed the posture information of the historical frames into a latent space, and the second one is employed to predict the human posture for the next frame. Moreover, our framework contains two Transformer-based controllers, which are used to model the constraints of the root trajectory and the velocity factor respectively, so as to better utilize the temporal context of the frames and achieve fine-grained motion control. We verify the proposed approach on a dance dataset containing a wide range of contemporary dance. The results of three quantitative analyses validate the superiority of our algorithm. The video and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the complex motion sequences generated by our algorithm can achieve diverse and smooth motion transitions between keyframes, even for long-term synthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper focuses on designing a noise-robust end-to-end Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) system. To this end, we propose Visual Context-driven Audio Feature Enhancement module (V-CAFE) to enhance the input noisy audio speech with a help of audio-visual correspondence. The proposed V-CAFE is designed to capture the transition of lip movements, namely visual context and to generate a noise reduction mask by considering the obtained visual context. Through context-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be refined for mask generation. The noisy representations are masked out with the noise reduction mask resulting in enhanced audio features. The enhanced audio features are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder model composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the proposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the noise-robustness of AVSR. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in noisy speech recognition and overlapped speech recognition experiments using the two largest audio-visual datasets, LRS2 and LRS3.

 - **Abstract**
 Traffic sign detection is a vital task in the visual system of self-driving cars and the automated driving system. Recently, novel Transformer-based models have achieved encouraging results for various computer vision tasks. We still observed that vanilla ViT could not yield satisfactory results in traffic sign detection because the overall size of the datasets is very small and the class distribution of traffic signs is extremely unbalanced. To overcome this problem, a novel Pyramid Transformer with locality mechanisms is proposed in this paper. Specifically, Pyramid Transformer has several spatial pyramid reduction layers to shrink and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using atrous convolutions. Moreover, it inherits an intrinsic scale invariance inductive bias and is able to learn local feature representation for objects at various scales, thereby enhancing the network robustness against the size discrepancy of traffic signs. The experiments are conducted on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB). The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the traffic sign detection tasks. More specifically, Pyramid Transformer achieves 75.6% mAP in GTSDB when applied to the Cascade RCNN as the backbone and surpassing most well-known and widely used SOTAs.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new transformer model for the task of unsupervised learning of skeleton motion sequences. The existing transformer model utilized for unsupervised skeleton-based action learning is learned the instantaneous velocity of each joint from adjacent frames without global motion information. Thus, the model has difficulties in learning the attention globally over whole-body motions and temporally distant joints. In addition, person-to-person interactions have not been considered in the model. To tackle the learning of whole-body motion, long-range temporal dynamics, and person-to-person interactions, we design a global and local attention mechanism, where, global body motions and local joint motions pay attention to each other. In addition, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, multi-interval pose displacement prediction, to learn both global and local attention in diverse time ranges. The proposed model successfully learns local dynamics of the joints and captures global context from the motion sequences. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models by notable margins in the representative benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Boeun-Kim/GL-Transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 One key challenge of exemplar-guided image generation lies in establishing fine-grained correspondences between input and guided images. Prior approaches, despite the promising results, have relied on either estimating dense attention to compute per-point matching, which is limited to only coarse scales due to the quadratic memory cost, or fixing the number of correspondences to achieve linear complexity, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sparse attention based Transformer model, termed Dynamic Sparse Transformer (DynaST), to achieve fine-level matching with favorable efficiency. The heart of our approach is a novel dynamic-attention unit, dedicated to covering the variation on the optimal number of tokens one position should focus on. Specifically, DynaST leverages the multi-layer nature of Transformer structure, and performs the dynamic attention scheme in a cascaded manner to refine matching results and synthesize visually-pleasing outputs. In addition, we introduce a unified training objective for DynaST, making it a versatile reference-based image translation framework for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on three applications, pose-guided person image generation, edge-based face synthesis, and undistorted image style transfer, demonstrate that DynaST achieves superior performance in local details, outperforming the state of the art while reducing the computational cost significantly. Our code is available at https://github.com/Huage001/DynaST

 - **Abstract**
 The past several years have witnessed Variational Auto-Encoder's superiority in various text generation tasks. However, due to the sequential nature of the text, auto-regressive decoders tend to ignore latent variables and then reduce to simple language models, known as the KL vanishing problem, which would further deteriorate when VAE is combined with Transformer-based structures. To ameliorate this problem, we propose DELLA, a novel variational Transformer framework. DELLA learns a series of layer-wise latent variables with each inferred from those of lower layers and tightly coupled with the hidden states by low-rank tensor product. In this way, DELLA forces these posterior latent variables to be fused deeply with the whole computation path and hence incorporate more information. We theoretically demonstrate that our method can be regarded as entangling latent variables to avoid posterior information decrease through layers, enabling DELLA to get higher non-zero KL values even without any annealing or thresholding tricks. Experiments on four unconditional and three conditional generation tasks show that DELLA could better alleviate KL vanishing and improve both quality and diversity compared to several strong baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose a genuine group-level contrastive visual representation learning method whose linear evaluation performance on ImageNet surpasses the vanilla supervised learning. Two mainstream unsupervised learning schemes are the instance-level contrastive framework and clustering-based schemes. The former adopts the extremely fine-grained instance-level discrimination whose supervisory signal is not efficient due to the false negatives. Though the latter solves this, they commonly come with some restrictions affecting the performance. To integrate their advantages, we design the SMoG method. SMoG follows the framework of contrastive learning but replaces the contrastive unit from instance to group, mimicking clustering-based methods. To achieve this, we propose the momentum grouping scheme which synchronously conducts feature grouping with representation learning. In this way, SMoG solves the problem of supervisory signal hysteresis which the clustering-based method usually faces, and reduces the false negatives of instance contrastive methods. We conduct exhaustive experiments to show that SMoG works well on both CNN and Transformer backbones. Results prove that SMoG has surpassed the current SOTA unsupervised representation learning methods. Moreover, its linear evaluation results surpass the performances obtained by vanilla supervised learning and the representation can be well transferred to downstream tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) is susceptible to various distortions (e.g., artifacts and noise), which severely compromise the exact diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The appropriate CCTA Vessel-level Image Quality Assessment (CCTA VIQA) algorithm can be used to reduce the risk of error diagnosis. The primary challenges of CCTA VIQA are that the local part of coronary that determines final quality is hard to locate. To tackle the challenge, we formulate CCTA VIQA as a multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem, and exploit Transformer-based MIL backbone (termed as T-MIL) to aggregate the multiple instances along the coronary centerline into the final quality. However, not all instances are informative for final quality. There are some quality-irrelevant/negative instances intervening the exact quality assessment(e.g., instances covering only background or the coronary in instances is not identifiable). Therefore, we propose a Progressive Reinforcement learning based Instance Discarding module (termed as PRID) to progressively remove quality-irrelevant/negative instances for CCTA VIQA. Based on the above two modules, we propose a Reinforced Transformer Network (RTN) for automatic CCTA VIQA based on end-to-end optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the real-world CCTA dataset, exceeding previous MIL methods by a large margin.

 - **Abstract**
 Humans have an innate ability to sense their surroundings, as they can extract the spatial representation from the egocentric perception and form an allocentric semantic map via spatial transformation and memory updating. However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map. In contrast, Trans4Map achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing 67.2% parameters, yet gaining a +3.25% mIoU and a +4.09% mBF1 improvements on the Matterport3D dataset. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jamycheung/Trans4Map.
### Entry-Flipped Transformer for Inference and Prediction of Participant  Behavior

 - **Abstract**
 Some group activities, such as team sports and choreographed dances, involve closely coupled interaction between participants. Here we investigate the tasks of inferring and predicting participant behavior, in terms of motion paths and actions, under such conditions. We narrow the problem to that of estimating how a set target participants react to the behavior of other observed participants. Our key idea is to model the spatio-temporal relations among participants in a manner that is robust to error accumulation during frame-wise inference and prediction. We propose a novel Entry-Flipped Transformer (EF-Transformer), which models the relations of participants by attention mechanisms on both spatial and temporal domains. Unlike typical transformers, we tackle the problem of error accumulation by flipping the order of query, key, and value entries, to increase the importance and fidelity of observed features in the current frame. Comparative experiments show that our EF-Transformer achieves the best performance on a newly-collected tennis doubles dataset, a Ceilidh dance dataset, and two pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that our EF-Transformer is better at limiting accumulated errors and recovering from wrong estimations.

 - **Abstract**
 As demonstrated by GPT-3 and T5, transformers grow in capability as parameter spaces become larger and larger. However, for tasks that require a large amount of knowledge, non-parametric memory allows models to grow dramatically with a sub-linear increase in computational cost and GPU memory requirements. Recent models such as RAG and REALM have introduced retrieval into conditional generation. These models incorporate neural initial retrieval from a corpus of passages. We build on this line of research, proposing Re2G, which combines both neural initial retrieval and reranking into a BART-based sequence-to-sequence generation. Our reranking approach also permits merging retrieval results from sources with incomparable scores, enabling an ensemble of BM25 and neural initial retrieval. To train our system end-to-end, we introduce a novel variation of knowledge distillation to train the initial retrieval, reranker, and generation using only ground truth on the target sequence output. We find large gains in four diverse tasks: zero-shot slot filling, question answering, fact-checking, and dialog, with relative gains of 9% to 34% over the previous state-of-the-art on the KILT leaderboard. We make our code available as open source at https://github.com/IBM/kgi-slot-filling/tree/re2g.

 - **Abstract**
 Mirror detection aims to identify the mirror regions in the given input image. Existing works mainly focus on integrating the semantic features and structural features to mine the similarity and discontinuity between mirror and non-mirror regions, or introducing depth information to help analyze the existence of mirrors. In this work, we observe that a real object typically forms a loose symmetry relationship with its corresponding reflection in the mirror, which is beneficial in distinguishing mirrors from real objects. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-path Symmetry-Aware Transformer-based mirror detection Network (SATNet), which includes two novel modules: Symmetry-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) and Contrast and Fusion Decoder Module (CFDM). Specifically, we first introduce the transformer backbone to model global information aggregation in images, extracting multi-scale features in two paths. We then feed the high-level dual-path features to SAAMs to capture the symmetry relations. Finally, we fuse the dual-path features and refine our prediction maps progressively with CFDMs to obtain the final mirror mask. Experimental results show that SATNet outperforms both RGB and RGB-D mirror detection methods on all available mirror detection datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first confirmed case caused by this virus was found at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. This case then spread throughout the world, including Indonesia. Therefore, the COVID-19 case was designated as a global pandemic by WHO. The growth of COVID-19 cases, especially in Indonesia, can be predicted using several approaches, such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN). One of the DNN models that can be used is Deep Transformer which can predict time series. The model is trained with several test scenarios to get the best model. The evaluation is finding the best hyperparameters. Then, further evaluation was carried out using the best hyperparameters setting of the number of prediction days, the optimizer, the number of features, and comparison with the former models of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). All evaluations used metric of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Based on the results of the evaluations, Deep Transformer produces the best results when using the Pre-Layer Normalization and predicting one day ahead with a MAPE value of 18.83. Furthermore, the model trained with the Adamax optimizer obtains the best performance among other tested optimizers. The performance of the Deep Transformer also exceeds other test models, which are LSTM and RNN.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer models have recently emerged as one of the foundational models in natural language processing, and as a byproduct, there is significant recent interest and investment in scaling these models. However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer. We open-source our model for reproducibility purposes in Jax.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper studies a simple extension of image-based Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to self-supervised representation learning from audio spectrograms. Following the Transformer encoder-decoder design in MAE, our Audio-MAE first encodes audio spectrogram patches with a high masking ratio, feeding only the non-masked tokens through encoder layers. The decoder then re-orders and decodes the encoded context padded with mask tokens, in order to reconstruct the input spectrogram. We find it beneficial to incorporate local window attention in the decoder, as audio spectrograms are highly correlated in local time and frequency bands. We then fine-tune the encoder with a lower masking ratio on target datasets. Empirically, Audio-MAE sets new state-of-the-art performance on six audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming other recent models that use external supervised pre-training. The code and models will be at https://github.com/facebookresearch/AudioMAE.

 - **Abstract**
 Motion forecasting for autonomous driving is a challenging task because complex driving scenarios result in a heterogeneous mix of static and dynamic inputs. It is an open problem how best to represent and fuse information about road geometry, lane connectivity, time-varying traffic light state, and history of a dynamic set of agents and their interactions into an effective encoding. To model this diverse set of input features, many approaches proposed to design an equally complex system with a diverse set of modality specific modules. This results in systems that are difficult to scale, extend, or tune in rigorous ways to trade off quality and efficiency. In this paper, we present Wayformer, a family of attention based architectures for motion forecasting that are simple and homogeneous. Wayformer offers a compact model description consisting of an attention based scene encoder and a decoder. In the scene encoder we study the choice of early, late and hierarchical fusion of the input modalities. For each fusion type we explore strategies to tradeoff efficiency and quality via factorized attention or latent query attention. We show that early fusion, despite its simplicity of construction, is not only modality agnostic but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both Waymo Open MotionDataset (WOMD) and Argoverse leaderboards, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design philosophy

 - **Abstract**
 Point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted attentions due to its robustness to light condition. This makes it an ideal semantic solution for autonomous driving. However, considering the large computation burden and bandwidth demanding of neural networks, putting all the computing into vehicle Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is not efficient or practical. In this paper, we proposed a light weighted point cloud semantic segmentation network based on range view. Due to its simple pre-processing and standard convolution, it is efficient when running on deep learning accelerator like DPU. Furthermore, a near sensor computing system is built for autonomous vehicles. In this system, a FPGA-based deep learning accelerator core (DPU) is placed next to the LiDAR sensor, to perform point cloud pre-processing and segmentation neural network. By leaving only the post-processing step to ECU, this solution heavily alleviate the computation burden of ECU and consequently shortens the decision making and vehicles reaction latency. Our semantic segmentation network achieved 10 frame per second (fps) on Xilinx DPU with computation efficiency 42.5 GOP/W.

 - **Abstract**
 Great progress has been achieved in the community of autonomous driving in the past few years. As a safety-critical problem, however, anomaly detection is a huge hurdle towards a large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles in the real world. While many approaches, such as uncertainty estimation or segmentation-based image resynthesis, are extremely promising, there is more to be explored. Especially inspired by works on anomaly detection based on image resynthesis, we propose a novel approach for anomaly detection through style transfer. We leverage generative models to map an image from its original style domain of road traffic to an arbitrary one and back to generate pixelwise anomaly scores. However, our experiments have proven our hypothesis wrong, and we were unable to produce significant results. Nevertheless, we want to share our findings, so that others can learn from our experiments.

 Autonomous driving is a key technology towards a brighter, more sustainable future. To enable such a future, it is necessary to utilize autonomous vehicles in shared mobility models. However, to evaluate, whether two or more route requests have the potential for a shared ride, is a compute-intensive task, if done by rerouting. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Longest Common Subsequences algorithm for fast and cost-efficient comparison of two routes for their compatibility, dynamically only incorporating parts of the routes which are suited for a shared trip. Based on this, one can also estimate, how many autonomous vehicles might be necessary to fulfill the local mobility demands. This can help providers to estimate the necessary fleet sizes, policymakers to better understand mobility patterns and cities to scale necessary infrastructure.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic pseudo-labeling is a powerful tool to tap into large amounts of sequential unlabeled data. It is especially appealing in safety-critical applications of autonomous driving where performance requirements are extreme, datasets large, and manual labeling is very challenging. We propose to leverage the sequentiality of the captures to boost the pseudo-labeling technique in a teacher-student setup via training multiple teachers, each with access to different temporal information. This set of teachers, dubbed Concordance, provides higher quality pseudo-labels for the student training than standard methods. The output of multiple teachers is combined via a novel pseudo-label confidence-guided criterion. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the 3D point cloud domain in urban driving scenarios. We show the performance of our method applied to multiple model architectures with tasks of 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection on two benchmark datasets. Our method, using only 20% of manual labels, outperforms some of the fully supervised methods. Special performance boost is achieved for classes rarely appearing in the training data, e.g., bicycles and pedestrians. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/ctu-vras/T-Concord3D.

 - **Abstract**
 Depth estimation is one of the key technologies in some fields such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, the traditional method of using a single sensor is inevitably limited by the performance of the sensor. Therefore, a precision and robust method for fusing the LiDAR and stereo cameras is proposed. This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and stereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the LiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the traditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting conditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the LiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the density of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted disparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method. Secondly, in order to make full use of the precise disparity map, the disparity map and stereo matching are fused to propagate the accurate disparity. Finally, the disparity map is converted to the depth map. Moreover, the converted disparity map can also increase the speed of the algorithm. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on the KITTI benchmark. The experiment demonstrates that our algorithm has higher accuracy than several classic methods.
