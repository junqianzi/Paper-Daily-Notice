 - **Abstract**
 Visually impaired people usually find it hard to travel independently in many public places such as airports and shopping malls due to the problems of obstacle avoidance and guidance to the desired location. Therefore, in the highly dynamic indoor environment, how to improve indoor navigation robot localization and navigation accuracy so that they guide the visually impaired well becomes a problem. One way is to use visual SLAM. However, typical visual SLAM either assumes a static environment, which may lead to less accurate results in dynamic environments or assumes that the targets are all dynamic and removes all the feature points above, sacrificing computational speed to a large extent with the available computational power. This paper seeks to explore marginal localization and navigation systems for indoor navigation robotics. The proposed system is designed to improve localization and navigation accuracy in highly dynamic environments by identifying and tracking potentially moving objects and using vector field histograms for local path planning and obstacle avoidance. The system has been tested on a public indoor RGB-D dataset, and the results show that the new system improves accuracy and robustness while reducing computation time in highly dynamic indoor scenes.

 - **Abstract**
 Real-time monocular 3D reconstruction is a challenging problem that remains unsolved. Although recent end-to-end methods have demonstrated promising results, tiny structures and geometric boundaries are hardly captured due to their insufficient supervision neglecting spatial details and oversimplified feature fusion ignoring temporal cues. To address the problems, we propose an end-to-end 3D reconstruction network SST, which utilizes Sparse estimated points from visual SLAM system as additional Spatial guidance and fuses Temporal features via a novel cross-modal attention mechanism, achieving more detailed reconstruction results. We propose a Local Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to exploit more informative spatial-temporal cues from multi-view color information and sparse priors, as well a Global Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to refine the local TSDF volumes with the world-frame model from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes demonstrate that SST outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors, whilst keeping a high inference speed at 59 FPS, enabling real-world applications with real-time requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 Fusing camera with LiDAR is a promising technique to improve the accuracy of 3D detection due to the complementary physical properties. While most existing methods focus on fusing camera features directly with raw LiDAR point clouds or shallow 3D features, it is observed that direct deep 3D feature fusion achieves inferior accuracy due to feature misalignment. The misalignment that originates from the feature aggregation across large receptive fields becomes increasingly severe for deep network stages. In this paper, we propose PathFusion to enable path-consistent LiDAR-camera deep feature fusion. PathFusion introduces a path consistency loss between shallow and deep features, which encourages the 2D backbone and its fusion path to transform 2D features in a way that is semantically aligned with the transform of the 3D backbone. We apply PathFusion to the prior-art fusion baseline, Focals Conv, and observe more than 1.2\% mAP improvements on the nuScenes test split consistently with and without testing-time augmentations. Moreover, PathFusion also improves KITTI AP3D (R11) by more than 0.6% on moderate level.

 - **Abstract**
 LiDAR mapping is important yet challenging in self-driving and mobile robotics. To tackle such a global point cloud registration problem, DeepMapping converts the complex map estimation into a self-supervised training of simple deep networks. Despite its broad convergence range on small datasets, DeepMapping still cannot produce satisfactory results on large-scale datasets with thousands of frames. This is due to the lack of loop closures and exact cross-frame point correspondences, and the slow convergence of its global localization network. We propose DeepMapping2 by adding two novel techniques to address these issues: (1) organization of training batch based on map topology from loop closing, and (2) self-supervised local-to-global point consistency loss leveraging pairwise registration. Our experiments and ablation studies on public datasets (KITTI, NCLT, and Nebula) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code will be released.

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic neural network (PNN) is a remarkable analog artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator that computes with photons instead of electrons to feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high parallelism. However, the existing training approaches cannot address the extensive accumulation of systematic errors in large-scale PNNs, resulting in a significant decrease in model performance in physical systems. Here, we propose dual adaptive training (DAT) that allows the PNN model to adapt to substantial systematic errors and preserves its performance during the deployment. By introducing the systematic error prediction networks with task-similarity joint optimization, DAT achieves the high similarity mapping between the PNN numerical models and physical systems and high-accurate gradient calculations during the dual backpropagation training. We validated the effectiveness of DAT by using diffractive PNNs and interference-based PNNs on image classification tasks. DAT successfully trained large-scale PNNs under major systematic errors and preserved the model classification accuracies comparable to error-free systems. The results further demonstrated its superior performance over the state-of-the-art in situ training approaches. DAT provides critical support for constructing large-scale PNNs to achieve advanced architectures and can be generalized to other types of AI systems with analog computing errors.

 - **Abstract**
 Partitioning applications between NDP and host CPU cores causes inter-segment data movement overhead, which is caused by moving data generated from one segment (e.g., instructions, functions) and used in consecutive segments. Prior works take two approaches to this problem. The first class of works maps segments to NDP or host cores based on the properties of each segment, neglecting the inter-segment data movement overhead. The second class of works partitions applications based on the overall memory bandwidth saving of each segment, and does not offload each segment to the best-fitting core if they incur high inter-segment data movement. We show that 1) mapping each segment to its best-fitting core ideally can provide substantial benefits, and 2) the inter-segment data movement reduces this benefit significantly. To this end, we introduce ALP, a new programmer-transparent technique to leverage the performance benefits of NDP by alleviating the inter-segment data movement overhead between host and memory and enabling efficient partitioning of applications. ALP alleviates the inter-segment data movement overhead by proactively and accurately transferring the required data between the segments. This is based on the key observation that the instructions that generate the inter-segment data stay the same across different executions of a program on different inputs. ALP uses a compiler pass to identify these instructions and uses specialized hardware to transfer data between the host and NDP cores at runtime. ALP efficiently maps application segments to either host or NDP considering 1) the properties of each segment, 2) the inter-segment data movement overhead, and 3) whether this overhead can be alleviated in a timely manner. We evaluate ALP across a wide range of workloads and show on average 54.3% and 45.4% speedup compared to only-host CPU or only-NDP executions, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural operators can learn nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces via deep neural networks. As promising surrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time prediction, deep neural operators such as deep operator networks (DeepONets) provide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven neural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to interpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the support of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world applications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is required, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep learning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep neural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation behavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity via the 2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new behavior of bias-variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity. Subsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation determination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a safe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information -- the governing PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods are based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for various types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical guidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the available information, desired accuracy, and required inference speed.

 - **Abstract**
 The power system is among the most important critical infrastructures in urban cities and is getting increasingly essential in supporting people s daily activities. However, it is also susceptible to most natural disasters such as tsunamis, floods, or earthquakes. Electricity vulnerability, therefore, forms a crucial basis for community resilience. This paper aims to present an assessment framework of spatial-temporal electricity vulnerability to support the building of community resilience against power outages. The framework includes vulnerability indexes in terms of occupant demographics, occupant activity patterns, and urban building characteristics. To integrate factors in these aspects, we also proposed a process as activity simulation-mapping-evaluation-visualization to apply the framework and visualize results. This framework can help planners make an effective first-time response by identifying the most vulnerable areas when a massive power outage happens during natural disasters. It can also be integrated into community resilience analysis models and potentially contributes to effective disaster risk management

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial intelligence is to teach machines to take actions like humans. To achieve intelligent teaching, the machine learning community becomes to think about a promising topic named machine teaching where the teacher is to design the optimal (usually minimal) teaching set given a target model and a specific learner. However, previous works usually require numerous teaching examples along with large iterations to guide learners to converge, which is costly. In this paper, we consider a more intelligent teaching paradigm named one-shot machine teaching which costs fewer examples to converge faster. Different from typical teaching, this advanced paradigm establishes a tractable mapping from the teaching set to the model parameter. Theoretically, we prove that this mapping is surjective, which serves to an existence guarantee of the optimal teaching set. Then, relying on the surjective mapping from the teaching set to the parameter, we develop a design strategy of the optimal teaching set under appropriate settings, of which two popular efficiency metrics, teaching dimension and iterative teaching dimension are one. Extensive experiments verify the efficiency of our strategy and further demonstrate the intelligence of this new teaching paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 Both clustering and outlier detection play an important role for meteorological measurements. We present the AWT algorithm, a clustering algorithm for time series data that also performs implicit outlier detection during the clustering. AWT integrates ideas of several well-known K-Means clustering algorithms. It chooses the number of clusters automatically based on a user-defined threshold parameter, and it can be used for heterogeneous meteorological input data as well as for data sets that exceed the available memory size. We apply AWT to crowd sourced 2-m temperature data with an hourly resolution from the city of Vienna to detect outliers and to investigate if the final clusters show general similarities and similarities with urban land-use characteristics. It is shown that both the outlier detection and the implicit mapping to land-use characteristic is possible with AWT which opens new possible fields of application, specifically in the rapidly evolving field of urban climate and urban weather.
### Towards Deeper and Better Multi-view Feature Fusion for 3D Semantic  Segmentation

 - **Abstract**
 3D point clouds are rich in geometric structure information, while 2D images contain important and continuous texture information. Combining 2D information to achieve better 3D semantic segmentation has become mainstream in 3D scene understanding. Albeit the success, it still remains elusive how to fuse and process the cross-dimensional features from these two distinct spaces. Existing state-of-the-art usually exploit bidirectional projection methods to align the cross-dimensional features and realize both 2D & 3D semantic segmentation tasks. However, to enable bidirectional mapping, this framework often requires a symmetrical 2D-3D network structure, thus limiting the network's flexibility. Meanwhile, such dual-task settings may distract the network easily and lead to over-fitting in the 3D segmentation task. As limited by the network's inflexibility, fused features can only pass through a decoder network, which affects model performance due to insufficient depth. To alleviate these drawbacks, in this paper, we argue that despite its simplicity, projecting unidirectionally multi-view 2D deep semantic features into the 3D space aligned with 3D deep semantic features could lead to better feature fusion. On the one hand, the unidirectional projection enforces our model focused more on the core task, i.e., 3D segmentation; on the other hand, unlocking the bidirectional to unidirectional projection enables a deeper cross-domain semantic alignment and enjoys the flexibility to fuse better and complicated features from very different spaces. In joint 2D-3D approaches, our proposed method achieves superior performance on the ScanNetv2 benchmark for 3D semantic segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Navigation is one of the most heavily studied problems in robotics, and is conventionally approached as a geometric mapping and planning problem. However, real-world navigation presents a complex set of physical challenges that defies simple geometric abstractions. Machine learning offers a promising way to go beyond geometry and conventional planning, allowing for navigational systems that make decisions based on actual prior experience. Such systems can reason about traversability in ways that go beyond geometry, accounting for the physical outcomes of their actions and exploiting patterns in real-world environments. They can also improve as more data is collected, potentially providing a powerful network effect. In this article, we present a general toolkit for experiential learning of robotic navigation skills that unifies several recent approaches, describe the underlying design principles, summarize experimental results from several of our recent papers, and discuss open problems and directions for future work.

### Dilation-Erosion for Single-Frame Supervised Temporal Action  Localization

 - **Abstract**
 To balance the annotation labor and the granularity of supervision, single-frame annotation has been introduced in temporal action localization. It provides a rough temporal location for an action but implicitly overstates the supervision from the annotated-frame during training, leading to the confusion between actions and backgrounds, i.e., action incompleteness and background false positives. To tackle the two challenges, in this work, we present the Snippet Classification model and the Dilation-Erosion module. In the Dilation-Erosion module, we expand the potential action segments with a loose criterion to alleviate the problem of action incompleteness and then remove the background from the potential action segments to alleviate the problem of action incompleteness. Relying on the single-frame annotation and the output of the snippet classification, the Dilation-Erosion module mines pseudo snippet-level ground-truth, hard backgrounds and evident backgrounds, which in turn further trains the Snippet Classification model. It forms a cyclic dependency. Furthermore, we propose a new embedding loss to aggregate the features of action instances with the same label and separate the features of actions from backgrounds. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.2 validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code has been made publicly available (https://github.com/LingJun123/single-frame-TAL).

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the development of a system able to estimate the 2D relative position of nodes in a wireless network, based on distance measurements between the nodes. The system uses ultra wide band ranging technology and the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol to acquire data. Furthermore, a nonlinear least squares problem is formulated and solved numerically for estimating the relative positions of the nodes. The localization performance of the system is validated by experimental tests, demonstrating the capability of measuring the relative position of a network comprised of 4 nodes with an accuracy of the order of 3 cm and an update rate of 10 Hz. This shows the feasibility of applying the proposed system for multi-robot cooperative localization and formation control scenarios.

 We implemented a system able to locate people indoor, with the purpose of providing assistive services. Such approach is particularly important for the Art, for providing information on exhibitions, art galleries and museums, and to allow the access to the cultural heritage patrimony to people with disabilities. The system may provide also very important information and input to elderly people, helping them to perceive more deeply the reality and the beauty of art. The system is based on Beacons, very small and low power consumption devices, and Human Body Communication protocols. The Beacons, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, allow to obtain a position information related to predetermined reference points, and through proximity algorithms, locate a person or an object of interest. The position obtained has an error that depends from the interferences present in the area. The union of Beacons with Human Body Communication, a recent wireless technology that exploits the human body as a transmission channel, makes it possible to increase the accuracy of localization. The basic idea is to exploit the localization derived from Beacons to start a search for an electrical signal transmitted by the human body and to distinguish the position according to the information contained in the signal. The signal is transmitted by capacitance to the human body and revealed by a special resonant circuit (antenna) adapted to the microphone input of the mobile device.

### Towards Better Long-range Time Series Forecasting using Generative  Forecasting

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06142
 - **Abstract**
 Long-range time series forecasting is usually based on one of two existing forecasting strategies: Direct Forecasting and Iterative Forecasting, where the former provides low bias, high variance forecasts and the latter leads to low variance, high bias forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting strategy called Generative Forecasting (GenF), which generates synthetic data for the next few time steps and then makes long-range forecasts based on generated and observed data. We theoretically prove that GenF is able to better balance the forecasting variance and bias, leading to a much smaller forecasting error. We implement GenF via three components: (i) a novel conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator for synthetic time series data generation, called CWGAN-TS. (ii) a transformer based predictor, which makes long-range predictions using both generated and observed data. (iii) an information theoretic clustering algorithm to improve the training of both the CWGAN-TS and the transformer based predictor. The experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that GenF significantly outperforms a diverse range of state-of-the-art benchmarks and classical approaches. Specifically, we find a 5% - 11% improvement in predictive performance (mean absolute error) while having a 15% - 50% reduction in parameters compared to the benchmarks. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to further explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of the components comprising GenF.

 - **Abstract**
 The importance of learning rate (LR) schedules on network pruning has been observed in a few recent works. As an example, Frankle and Carbin (2019) highlighted that winning tickets (i.e., accuracy preserving subnetworks) can not be found without applying a LR warmup schedule and Renda, Frankle and Carbin (2020) demonstrated that rewinding the LR to its initial state at the end of each pruning cycle improves performance. In this paper, we go one step further by first providing a theoretical justification for the surprising effect of LR schedules. Next, we propose a LR schedule for network pruning called SILO, which stands for S-shaped Improved Learning rate Optimization. The advantages of SILO over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LR schedules are two-fold: (i) SILO has a strong theoretical motivation and dynamically adjusts the LR during pruning to improve generalization. Specifically, SILO increases the LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape. This leads to an improvement of 2% - 4% in extensive experiments with various types of networks (e.g., Vision Transformers, ResNet) on popular datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100. (ii) In addition to the strong theoretical motivation, SILO is empirically optimal in the sense of matching an Oracle, which exhaustively searches for the optimal value of max_lr via grid search. We find that SILO is able to precisely adjust the value of max_lr to be within the Oracle optimized interval, resulting in performance competitive with the Oracle with significantly lower complexity.
### AP: Selective Activation for De-sparsifying Pruned Neural Networks

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06145
 - **Abstract**
 The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a highly successful activation function in neural networks as it allows networks to easily obtain sparse representations, which reduces overfitting in overparameterized networks. However, in network pruning, we find that the sparsity introduced by ReLU, which we quantify by a term called dynamic dead neuron rate (DNR), is not beneficial for the pruned network. Interestingly, the more the network is pruned, the smaller the dynamic DNR becomes during optimization. This motivates us to propose a method to explicitly reduce the dynamic DNR for the pruned network, i.e., de-sparsify the network. We refer to our method as Activating-while-Pruning (AP). We note that AP does not function as a stand-alone method, as it does not evaluate the importance of weights. Instead, it works in tandem with existing pruning methods and aims to improve their performance by selective activation of nodes to reduce the dynamic DNR. We conduct extensive experiments using popular networks (e.g., ResNet, VGG) via two classical and three state-of-the-art pruning methods. The experimental results on public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100) suggest that AP works well with existing pruning methods and improves the performance by 3% - 4%. For larger scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and state-of-the-art networks (e.g., vision transformer), we observe an improvement of 2% - 3% with AP as opposed to without. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to examine the effectiveness of the components comprising AP.

 - **Abstract**
 Spurious correlations in training data often lead to robustness issues since models learn to use them as shortcuts. For example, when predicting whether an object is a cow, a model might learn to rely on its green background, so it would do poorly on a cow on a sandy background. A standard dataset for measuring state-of-the-art on methods mitigating this problem is Waterbirds. The best method (Group Distributionally Robust Optimization - GroupDRO) currently achieves 89\% worst group accuracy and standard training from scratch on raw images only gets 72\%. GroupDRO requires training a model in an end-to-end manner with subgroup labels. In this paper, we show that we can achieve up to 90\% accuracy without using any sub-group information in the training set by simply using embeddings from a large pre-trained vision model extractor and training a linear classifier on top of it. With experiments on a wide range of pre-trained models and pre-training datasets, we show that the capacity of the pre-training model and the size of the pre-training dataset matters. Our experiments reveal that high capacity vision transformers perform better compared to high capacity convolutional neural networks, and larger pre-training dataset leads to better worst-group accuracy on the spurious correlation dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Intensive Care in-hospital mortality prediction has various clinical applications. Neural prediction models, especially when capitalising on clinical notes, have been put forward as improvement on currently existing models. However, to be acceptable these models should be performant and transparent. This work studies different attention mechanisms for clinical neural prediction models in terms of their discrimination and calibration. Specifically, we investigate sparse attention as an alternative to dense attention weights in the task of in-hospital mortality prediction from clinical notes. We evaluate the attention mechanisms based on: i) local self-attention over words in a sentence, and ii) global self-attention with a transformer architecture across sentences. We demonstrate that the sparse mechanism approach outperforms the dense one for the local self-attention in terms of predictive performance with a publicly available dataset, and puts higher attention to prespecified relevant directive words. The performance at the sentence level, however, deteriorates as sentences including the influential directive words tend to be dropped all together.

 The identification of addiction-related circuits is critical for explaining addiction processes and developing addiction treatments. And models of functional addiction circuits developed from functional imaging are an effective tool for discovering and verifying addiction circuits. However, analyzing functional imaging data of addiction and detecting functional addiction circuits still have challenges. We have developed a data-driven and end-to-end generative artificial intelligence(AI) framework to address these difficulties. The framework integrates dynamic brain network modeling and novel network architecture networks architecture, including temporal graph Transformer and contrastive learning modules. A complete workflow is formed by our generative AI framework: the functional imaging data, from neurobiological experiments, and computational modeling, to end-to-end neural networks, is transformed into dynamic nicotine addiction-related circuits. It enables the detection of addiction-related brain circuits with dynamic properties and reveals the underlying mechanisms of addiction.

 - **Abstract**
 The exercise of detecting similar bug reports in bug tracking systems is known as duplicate bug report detection. Having prior knowledge of a bug report's existence reduces efforts put into debugging problems and identifying the root cause. Rule and Query-based solutions recommend a long list of potential similar bug reports with no clear ranking. In addition, triage engineers are less motivated to spend time going through an extensive list. Consequently, this deters the use of duplicate bug report retrieval solutions. In this paper, we have proposed a solution using a combination of NLP techniques. Our approach considers unstructured and structured attributes of a bug report like summary, description and severity, impacted products, platforms, categories, etc. It uses a custom data transformer, a deep neural network, and a non-generalizing machine learning method to retrieve existing identical bug reports. We have performed numerous experiments with significant data sources containing thousands of bug reports and showcased that the proposed solution achieves a high retrieval accuracy of 70% for recall@5.

 - **Abstract**
 How to identify and segment camouflaged objects from the background is challenging. Inspired by the multi-head self-attention in Transformers, we present a simple masked separable attention (MSA) for camouflaged object detection. We first separate the multi-head self-attention into three parts, which are responsible for distinguishing the camouflaged objects from the background using different mask strategies. Furthermore, we propose to capture high-resolution semantic representations progressively based on a simple top-down decoder with the proposed MSA to attain precise segmentation results. These structures plus a backbone encoder form a new model, dubbed CamoFormer. Extensive experiments show that CamoFormer surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods on three widely-used camouflaged object detection benchmarks. There are on average around 5% relative improvements over previous methods in terms of S-measure and weighted F-measure.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of transformers and masked image modeling (MIM) pre-training framework has shown great potential in various vision tasks. However, the pre-training computational budget is too heavy and withholds the MIM from becoming a practical training paradigm. This paper presents FastMIM, a simple and generic framework for expediting masked image modeling with the following two steps: (i) pre-training vision backbones with low-resolution input images; and (ii) reconstructing Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature instead of original RGB values of the input images. In addition, we propose FastMIM-P to progressively enlarge the input resolution during pre-training stage to further enhance the transfer results of models with high capacity. We point out that: (i) a wide range of input resolutions in pre-training phase can lead to similar performances in fine-tuning phase and downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation; (ii) the shallow layers of encoder are more important during pre-training and discarding last several layers can speed up the training stage with no harm to fine-tuning performance; (iii) the decoder should match the size of selected network; and (iv) HOG is more stable than RGB values when resolution transfers;. Equipped with FastMIM, all kinds of vision backbones can be pre-trained in an efficient way. For example, we can achieve 83.8%/84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/Swin-B as backbones. Compared to previous relevant approaches, we can achieve comparable or better top-1 accuracy while accelerate the training procedure by $\sim$5$\times$.

 - **Abstract**
 Patch-based models, e.g., Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Mixers, have shown impressive results on various visual recognition tasks, alternating classic convolutional networks. While the initial patch-based models (ViTs) treated all patches equally, recent studies reveal that incorporating inductive bias like spatiality benefits the representations. However, most prior works solely focused on the location of patches, overlooking the scene structure of images. Thus, we aim to further guide the interaction of patches using the object information. Specifically, we propose OAMixer (object-aware mixing layer), which calibrates the patch mixing layers of patch-based models based on the object labels. Here, we obtain the object labels in unsupervised or weakly-supervised manners, i.e., no additional human-annotating cost is necessary. Using the object labels, OAMixer computes a reweighting mask with a learnable scale parameter that intensifies the interaction of patches containing similar objects and applies the mask to the patch mixing layers. By learning an object-centric representation, we demonstrate that OAMixer improves the classification accuracy and background robustness of various patch-based models, including ViTs, MLP-Mixers, and ConvMixers. Moreover, we show that OAMixer enhances various downstream tasks, including large-scale classification, self-supervised learning, and multi-object recognition, verifying the generic applicability of OAMixer

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art image and text classification models, such as Convectional Neural Networks and Transformers, have long been able to classify their respective unimodal reasoning satisfactorily with accuracy close to or exceeding human accuracy. However, images embedded with text, such as hateful memes, are hard to classify using unimodal reasoning when difficult examples, such as benign confounders, are incorporated into the data set. We attempt to generate more labeled memes in addition to the Hateful Memes data set from Facebook AI, based on the framework of a winning team from the Hateful Meme Challenge. To increase the number of labeled memes, we explore semi-supervised learning using pseudo-labels for newly introduced, unlabeled memes gathered from the Memotion Dataset 7K. We find that the semi-supervised learning task on unlabeled data required human intervention and filtering and that adding a limited amount of new data yields no extra classification performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Object detection, one of the three main tasks of computer vision, has been used in various applications. The main process is to use deep neural networks to extract the features of an image and then use the features to identify the class and location of an object. Therefore, the main direction to improve the accuracy of object detection tasks is to improve the neural network to extract features better. In this paper, I propose a convolutional module with a transformer[1], which aims to improve the recognition accuracy of the model by fusing the detailed features extracted by CNN[2] with the global features extracted by a transformer and significantly reduce the computational effort of the transformer module by deflating the feature mAP. The main execution steps are convolutional downsampling to reduce the feature map size, then self-attention calculation and upsampling, and finally concatenation with the initial input. In the experimental part, after splicing the block to the end of YOLOv5n[3] and training 300 epochs on the coco dataset, the mAP improved by 1.7% compared with the previous YOLOv5n, and the mAP curve did not show any saturation phenomenon, so there is still potential for improvement. After 100 rounds of training on the Pascal VOC dataset, the accuracy of the results reached 81%, which is 4.6 better than the faster RCNN[4] using resnet101[5] as the backbone, but the number of parameters is less than one-twentieth of it.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers (ViTs) are quickly becoming the de-facto architecture for computer vision, yet we understand very little about why they work and what they learn. While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains challenging. In this paper, we first address the obstacles to performing visualizations on ViTs. Assisted by these solutions, we observe that neurons in ViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by semantic concepts rather than visual features. We also explore the underlying differences between ViTs and CNNs, and we find that transformers detect image background features, just like their convolutional counterparts, but their predictions depend far less on high-frequency information. On the other hand, both architecture types behave similarly in the way features progress from abstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects in late layers. In addition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except the final layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last layer most likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global pooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range of ViT variants, including DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to validate the effectiveness of our method.

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is essential for the better performance of deep learning, and practitioners often need to consider the trade-off between multiple metrics, such as error rate, latency, memory requirements, robustness, and algorithmic fairness. Due to this demand and the heavy computation of deep learning, the acceleration of multi-objective (MO) optimization becomes ever more important. Although meta-learning has been extensively studied to speedup HPO, existing methods are not applicable to the MO tree-structured parzen estimator (MO-TPE), a simple yet powerful MO-HPO algorithm. In this paper, we extend TPE's acquisition function to the meta-learning setting, using a task similarity defined by the overlap in promising domains of each task. In a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our method accelerates MO-TPE on tabular HPO benchmarks and yields state-of-the-art performance. Our method was also validated externally by winning the AutoML 2022 competition on "Multiobjective Hyperparameter Optimization for Transformers".

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require high-resolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/GPViT .

 - **Abstract**
 By transferring knowledge from large, diverse, task-agnostic datasets, modern machine learning models can solve specific downstream tasks either zero-shot or with small task-specific datasets to a high level of performance. While this capability has been demonstrated in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, it remains to be shown in robotics, where the generalization capabilities of the models are particularly critical due to the difficulty of collecting real-world robotic data. We argue that one of the keys to the success of such general robotic models lies with open-ended task-agnostic training, combined with high-capacity architectures that can absorb all of the diverse, robotic data. In this paper, we present a model class, dubbed Robotics Transformer, that exhibits promising scalable model properties. We verify our conclusions in a study of different model classes and their ability to generalize as a function of the data size, model size, and data diversity based on a large-scale data collection on real robots performing real-world tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce Structured 3D Features, a model based on a novel implicit 3D representation that pools pixel-aligned image features onto dense 3D points sampled from a parametric, statistical human mesh surface. The 3D points have associated semantics and can move freely in 3D space. This allows for optimal coverage of the person of interest, beyond just the body shape, which in turn, additionally helps modeling accessories, hair, and loose clothing. Owing to this, we present a complete 3D transformer-based attention framework which, given a single image of a person in an unconstrained pose, generates an animatable 3D reconstruction with albedo and illumination decomposition, as a result of a single end-to-end model, trained semi-supervised, and with no additional postprocessing. We show that our S3F model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on various tasks, including monocular 3D reconstruction, as well as albedo and shading estimation. Moreover, we show that the proposed methodology allows novel view synthesis, relighting, and re-posing the reconstruction, and can naturally be extended to handle multiple input images (e.g. different views of a person, or the same view, in different poses, in video). Finally, we demonstrate the editing capabilities of our model for 3D virtual try-on applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Pedestrian safety is one primary concern in autonomous driving. The under-representation of vulnerable groups in today's pedestrian datasets points to an urgent need for a dataset of vulnerable road users. In this paper, we first introduce a new vulnerable pedestrian detection dataset, BG Vulnerable Pedestrian (BGVP) dataset to help train well-rounded models and thus induce research to increase the efficacy of vulnerable pedestrian detection. The dataset includes four classes, i.e., Children Without Disability, Elderly without Disability, With Disability, and Non-Vulnerable. This dataset consists of images collected from the public domain and manually-annotated bounding boxes. In addition, on the proposed dataset, we have trained and tested five state-of-the-art object detection models, i.e., YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Our results indicate that YOLOX and YOLOv4 perform the best on our dataset, YOLOv4 scoring 0.7999 and YOLOX scoring 0.7779 on the mAP 0.5 metric, while YOLOX outperforms YOLOv4 by 3.8 percent on the mAP 0.5:0.95 metric. Generally speaking, all five detectors do well predicting the With Disability class and perform poorly in the Elderly Without Disability class. YOLOX consistently outperforms all other detectors on the mAP (0.5:0.95) per class metric, obtaining 0.5644, 0.5242, 0.4781, and 0.6796 for Children Without Disability, Elderly Without Disability, Non-vulnerable, and With Disability, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Edge-assisted vehicle-to-everything (V2X) motion planning is an emerging paradigm to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving, since it leverages the global position information shared among multiple vehicles. However, due to the imperfect channel state information (CSI), the position information of vehicles may become outdated and inaccurate. Conventional methods ignoring the communication delays could severely jeopardize driving safety. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a robust V2X motion planning policy that adapts between competitive driving under a low communication delay and conservative driving under a high communication delay, and guarantees small communication delays at key waypoints via power control. This is achieved by integrating the vehicle mobility and communication delay models and solving a joint design of motion planning and power control problem via the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results show that the proposed driving policy achieves the smallest collision ratio compared with other benchmark policies.
