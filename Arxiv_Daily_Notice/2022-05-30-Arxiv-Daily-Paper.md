 - **Abstract**
 The fusion of camera sensor and inertial data is a leading method for ego-motion tracking in autonomous and smart devices. State estimation techniques that rely on non-linear filtering are a strong paradigm for solving the associated information fusion task. The de facto inference method in this space is the celebrated extended Kalman filter (EKF), which relies on first-order linearizations of both the dynamical and measurement model. This paper takes a critical look at the practical implications and limitations posed by the EKF, especially under faulty visual feature associations and the presence of strong confounding noise. As an alternative, we revisit the assumed density formulation of Bayesian filtering and employ a moment matching (unscented Kalman filtering) approach to both visual-inertial odometry and visual SLAM. Our results highlight important aspects in robustness both in dynamics propagation and visual measurement updates, and we show state-of-the-art results on EuRoC MAV drone data benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust environment perception for autonomous vehicles is a tremendous challenge, which makes a diverse sensor set with e.g. camera, lidar and radar crucial. In the process of understanding the recorded sensor data, 3D semantic segmentation plays an important role. Therefore, this work presents a pyramid-based deep fusion architecture for lidar and camera to improve 3D semantic segmentation of traffic scenes. Individual sensor backbones extract feature maps of camera images and lidar point clouds. A novel Pyramid Fusion Backbone fuses these feature maps at different scales and combines the multimodal features in a feature pyramid to compute valuable multimodal, multi-scale features. The Pyramid Fusion Head aggregates these pyramid features and further refines them in a late fusion step, incorporating the final features of the sensor backbones. The approach is evaluated on two challenging outdoor datasets and different fusion strategies and setups are investigated. It outperforms recent range view based lidar approaches as well as all so far proposed fusion strategies and architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simple yet effective fully convolutional one-stage 3D object detector for LiDAR point clouds of autonomous driving scenes, termed FCOS-LiDAR. Unlike the dominant methods that use the bird-eye view (BEV), our proposed detector detects objects from the range view (RV, a.k.a. range image) of the LiDAR points. Due to the range view's compactness and compatibility with the LiDAR sensors' sampling process on self-driving cars, the range view-based object detector can be realized by solely exploiting the vanilla 2D convolutions, departing from the BEV-based methods which often involve complicated voxelization operations and sparse convolutions. For the first time, we show that an RV-based 3D detector with standard 2D convolutions alone can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art BEV-based detectors while being significantly faster and simpler. More importantly, almost all previous range view-based detectors only focus on single-frame point clouds, since it is challenging to fuse multi-frame point clouds into a single range view. In this work, we tackle this challenging issue with a novel range view projection mechanism, and for the first time demonstrate the benefits of fusing multi-frame point clouds for a range-view based detector. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show the superiority of our proposed method and we believe that our work can be strong evidence that an RV-based 3D detector can compare favourably with the current mainstream BEV-based detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Fusing the camera and LiDAR information has become a de-facto standard for 3D object detection tasks. Current methods rely on point clouds from the LiDAR sensor as queries to leverage the feature from the image space. However, people discover that this underlying assumption makes the current fusion framework infeasible to produce any prediction when there is a LiDAR malfunction, regardless of minor or major. This fundamentally limits the deployment capability to realistic autonomous driving scenarios. In contrast, we propose a surprisingly simple yet novel fusion framework, dubbed BEVFusion, whose camera stream does not depend on the input of LiDAR data, thus addressing the downside of previous methods. We empirically show that our framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods under the normal training settings. Under the robustness training settings that simulate various LiDAR malfunctions, our framework significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by 15.7% to 28.9% mAP. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to handle realistic LiDAR malfunction and can be deployed to realistic scenarios without any post-processing procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 Indoor exploration is an important task in disaster relief, emergency response scenarios, and Search And Rescue (SAR) missions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems can aid first responders by maneuvering autonomously in areas inside buildings dangerous for humans to traverse, exploring the interior, and providing an accurate and reliable indoor map before the emergency response team takes action. Due to the challenging conditions in such scenarios and the inherent battery limitations and time constraints, we investigate 2D autonomous exploration strategies (e.g., based on 2D LiDAR) for mapping 3D indoor environments. First, we introduce a battery consumption model to consider the battery life aspect for the first time as a critical factor for evaluating the flight endurance of exploration strategies. Second, we perform extensive simulation experiments in diverse indoor environments using various state-of-the-art 2D LiDAR-based exploration strategies. We evaluate our findings in terms of various quantitative and qualitative performance indicators, suggesting that these strategies behave differently depending on the complexity of the environment and initial conditions, e.g., the entry point.

 - **Abstract**
 Adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors have been studied extensively in the past few years. The proposed attacks aimed solely at compromising the models' integrity (i.e., trustworthiness of the model's prediction), while adversarial attacks targeting the models' availability, a critical aspect in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, have not been explored by the machine learning research community. In this paper, we propose NMS-Sponge, a novel approach that negatively affects the decision latency of YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detector, and compromises the model's availability by applying a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed UAP is able to increase the processing time of individual frames by adding "phantom" objects while preserving the detection of the original objects.

 - **Abstract**
 World models learn the consequences of actions in vision-based interactive systems. However, in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, there commonly exists noncontrollable dynamics independent of the action signals, making it difficult to learn effective world models. To tackle this problem, we present a novel reinforcement learning approach named Iso-Dream, which improves the Dream-to-Control framework in two aspects. First, by optimizing the inverse dynamics, we encourage the world model to learn controllable and noncontrollable sources of spatiotemporal changes on isolated state transition branches. Second, we optimize the behavior of the agent on the decoupled latent imaginations of the world model. Specifically, to estimate state values, we roll-out the noncontrollable states into the future and associate them with the current controllable state. In this way, the isolation of dynamics sources can greatly benefit long-horizon decision-making of the agent, such as a self-driving car that can avoid potential risks by anticipating the movement of other vehicles. Experiments show that Iso-Dream is effective in decoupling the mixed dynamics and remarkably outperforms existing approaches in a wide range of visual control and prediction domains.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate sensor calibration is a prerequisite for multi-sensor perception and localization systems for autonomous vehicles. The intrinsic parameter calibration of the sensor is to obtain the mapping relationship inside the sensor, and the extrinsic parameter calibration is to transform two or more sensors into a unified spatial coordinate system. Most sensors need to be calibrated after installation to ensure the accuracy of sensor measurements. To this end, we present OpenCalib, a calibration toolbox that contains a rich set of various sensor calibration methods. OpenCalib covers manual calibration tools, automatic calibration tools, factory calibration tools, and online calibration tools for different application scenarios. At the same time, to evaluate the calibration accuracy and subsequently improve the accuracy of the calibration algorithm, we released a corresponding benchmark dataset. This paper introduces various features and calibration methods of this toolbox. To our knowledge, this is the first open-sourced calibration codebase containing the full set of autonomous-driving-related calibration approaches in this area. We wish that the toolbox could be helpful to autonomous driving researchers. We have open-sourced our code on GitHub to benefit the community. Code is available at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research has sought to accelerate cryptographic hash functions as they are at the core of modern cryptography. Traditional designs, however, suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck that originates from the separation of processing and memory units. An emerging solution to overcome this bottleneck is processing-in-memory (PIM): performing logic within the same devices responsible for memory to eliminate data-transfer and simultaneously provide massive computational parallelism. In this paper, we seek to vastly accelerate the state-of-the-art SHA-3 cryptographic function using the memristive memory processing unit (mMPU), a general-purpose memristive PIM architecture. To that end, we propose a novel in-memory algorithm for variable rotation, and utilize an efficient mapping of the SHA-3 state vector for memristive crossbar arrays to efficiently exploit PIM parallelism. We demonstrate a massive energy efficiency of 1,422 Gbps/W, improving a state-of-the-art memristive SHA-3 accelerator (SHINE-2) by 4.6x.

 - **Abstract**
 The Streaming Engine (SE) is a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array which provides programming flexibility and high-performance with energy efficiency. An application program to be executed on the SE is represented as a combination of Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) graphs, where every instruction is represented as a node. Each node needs to be mapped to the right slot and array in the SE to ensure the correct execution of the program. This creates an optimization problem with a vast and sparse search space for which finding a mapping manually is impractical because it requires expertise and knowledge of the SE micro-architecture. In this work we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework with Global Graph Attention (GGA) module and output masking of invalid placements to find and optimize instruction schedules. We use Proximal Policy Optimization in order to train a model which places operations into the SE tiles based on a reward function that models the SE device and its constraints. The GGA module consists of a graph neural network and an attention module. The graph neural network creates embeddings of the SDFs and the attention block is used to model sequential operation placement. We show results on how certain workloads are mapped to the SE and the factors affecting mapping quality. We find that the addition of GGA, on average, finds 10% better instruction schedules in terms of total clock cycles taken and masking improves reward obtained by 20%.

 - **Abstract**
 Training deep learning-based change detection (CD) model heavily depends on labeled data. Contemporary transfer learning-based methods to alleviate the CD label insufficiency mainly upon ImageNet pre-training. A recent trend is using remote sensing (RS) data to obtain in-domain representations via supervised or self-supervised learning (SSL). Here, different from traditional supervised pre-training that learns the mapping from image to label, we leverage semantic supervision in a contrastive manner. There are typically multiple objects of interest (e.g., buildings) distributed in varying locations in RS images. We propose dense semantic-aware pre-training for RS image CD via sampling multiple class-balanced points. Instead of manipulating image-level representations that lack spatial information, we constrain pixel-level cross-view consistency and cross-semantic discrimination to learn spatially-sensitive features, thus benefiting downstream dense CD. Apart from learning illumination invariant features, we fulfill consistent foreground features insensitive to irrelevant background changes via a synthetic view using background swapping. We additionally achieve discriminative representations to distinguish foreground land-covers and others. We collect large-scale image-mask pairs freely available in the RS community for pre-training. Extensive experiments on three CD datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Ours significantly outperforms ImageNet, in-domain supervision, and several SSL methods. Empirical results indicate ours well alleviates data insufficiency in CD. Notably, we achieve competitive results using only 20% training data than baseline (random) using 100% data. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the generalization ability of our pre-trained model to downstream images even remaining domain gaps with the pre-training data. Our Code will make public.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects with image-level supervision. Existing works mainly rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) derived from a classification model. However, CAM-based methods usually focus on the most discriminative parts of an object (i.e., incomplete localization problem). In this paper, we empirically prove that this problem is associated with the mixup of the activation values between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. To address it, we propose Class RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM), a novel clustering-based approach to boost the activation values of the integral object regions. To this end, we introduce class-specific foreground and background context embeddings as cluster centroids. A CAM-guided momentum preservation strategy is developed to learn the context embeddings during training. At the inference stage, the re-activation mapping is formulated as a parameter estimation problem under Gaussian Mixture Model, which can be solved by deriving an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization based soft-clustering algorithm. By simply integrating CREAM into various WSOL approaches, our method significantly improves their performance. CREAM achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUB, ILSVRC and OpenImages benchmark datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/Jazzcharles/CREAM.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14125
 - **Abstract**
 Evolutionary algorithms solve problems by simulating the evolution of a population of candidate solutions. We focus on evolving permutations for ordering problems like the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), as well as assignment problems like the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and largest common subgraph (LCS). We propose cycle mutation, a new mutation operator whose inspiration is the well known cycle crossover operator, and the concept of a permutation cycle. We use fitness landscape analysis to explore the problem characteristics for which cycle mutation works best. As a prerequisite, we develop new permutation distance measures: cycle distance, $k$-cycle distance, and cycle edit distance. The fitness landscape analysis predicts that cycle mutation is better suited for assignment and mapping problems than it is for ordering problems. We experimentally validate these findings showing cycle mutation's strengths on problems like QAP and LCS, and its limitations on problems like the TSP, while also showing that it is less prone to local optima than commonly used alternatives. We integrate cycle mutation into the open-source Chips-n-Salsa library, and the new distance metrics into the open-source JavaPermutationTools library.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning approach has been demonstrated to automatically segment the bilateral mandibular canals from CBCT scans, yet systematic studies of its clinical and technical validation are scarce. To validate the mandibular canal localization accuracy of a deep learning system (DLS) we trained it with 982 CBCT scans and evaluated using 150 scans of five scanners from clinical workflow patients of European and Southeast Asian Institutes, annotated by four radiologists. The interobserver variability was compared to the variability between the DLS and the radiologists. In addition, the generalization of DLS to CBCT scans from scanners not used in the training data was examined to evaluate the out-of-distribution generalization capability. The DLS had lower variability to the radiologists than the interobserver variability between them and it was able to generalize to three new devices. For the radiologists' consensus segmentation, used as gold standard, the DLS had a symmetric mean curve distance of 0.39 mm compared to those of the individual radiologists with 0.62 mm, 0.55 mm, 0.47 mm, and 0.42 mm. The DLS showed comparable or slightly better performance in the segmentation of the mandibular canal with the radiologists and generalization capability to new scanners.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13977
 - **Abstract**
 To guide the movement of a robotic swarm in a corridor-like environment, a curve virtual tube with no obstacle inside is designed in our previous work. This paper generalizes the controller design to the condition that all robots have self-localization drifts and precise relative navigation, where the flocking algorithm is introduced to reduce the negative impact of the self-localization drift. It is shown that the cohesion behavior and the velocity alignment behavior are able to reduce the influence of the position measurement drift and the velocity measurement error, respectively. For the convenience in practical use, a modified vector field controller with five control terms is put forward. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by numerical simulations and real experiments.

 Accurate sensor calibration is a prerequisite for multi-sensor perception and localization systems for autonomous vehicles. The intrinsic parameter calibration of the sensor is to obtain the mapping relationship inside the sensor, and the extrinsic parameter calibration is to transform two or more sensors into a unified spatial coordinate system. Most sensors need to be calibrated after installation to ensure the accuracy of sensor measurements. To this end, we present OpenCalib, a calibration toolbox that contains a rich set of various sensor calibration methods. OpenCalib covers manual calibration tools, automatic calibration tools, factory calibration tools, and online calibration tools for different application scenarios. At the same time, to evaluate the calibration accuracy and subsequently improve the accuracy of the calibration algorithm, we released a corresponding benchmark dataset. This paper introduces various features and calibration methods of this toolbox. To our knowledge, this is the first open-sourced calibration codebase containing the full set of autonomous-driving-related calibration approaches in this area. We wish that the toolbox could be helpful to autonomous driving researchers. We have open-sourced our code on GitHub to benefit the community. Code is available at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper considers the Pointer Value Retrieval (PVR) benchmark introduced in [ZRKB21], where a 'reasoning' function acts on a string of digits to produce the label. More generally, the paper considers the learning of logical functions with gradient descent (GD) on neural networks. It is first shown that in order to learn logical functions with gradient descent on symmetric neural networks, the generalization error can be lower-bounded in terms of the noise-stability of the target function, supporting a conjecture made in [ZRKB21]. It is then shown that in the distribution shift setting, when the data withholding corresponds to freezing a single feature (referred to as canonical holdout), the generalization error of gradient descent admits a tight characterization in terms of the Boolean influence for several relevant architectures. This is shown on linear models and supported experimentally on other models such as MLPs and Transformers. In particular, this puts forward the hypothesis that for such architectures and for learning logical functions such as PVR functions, GD tends to have an implicit bias towards low-degree representations, which in turn gives the Boolean influence for the generalization error under quadratic loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven learning of partial differential equations' solution operators has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for approximating the underlying solutions. The solution operators are usually parameterized by deep learning models that are built upon problem-specific inductive biases. An example is a convolutional or a graph neural network that exploits the local grid structure where functions' values are sampled. The attention mechanism, on the other hand, provides a flexible way to implicitly exploit the patterns within inputs, and furthermore, relationship between arbitrary query locations and inputs. In this work, we present an attention-based framework for data-driven operator learning, which we term Operator Transformer (OFormer). Our framework is built upon self-attention, cross-attention, and a set of point-wise multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and thus it makes few assumptions on the sampling pattern of the input function or query locations. We show that the proposed framework is competitive on standard benchmark problems and can flexibly be adapted to randomly sampled input.

 - **Abstract**
 A core issue in federated reinforcement learning is defining how to aggregate insights from multiple agents into one. This is commonly done by taking the average of each participating agent's model weights into one common model (FedAvg). We instead propose FedFormer, a novel federation strategy that utilizes Transformer Attention to contextually aggregate embeddings from models originating from different learner agents. In so doing, we attentively weigh contributions of other agents with respect to the current agent's environment and learned relationships, thus providing more effective and efficient federation. We evaluate our methods on the Meta-World environment and find that our approach yields significant improvements over FedAvg and non-federated Soft Actor Critique single agent methods. Our results compared to Soft Actor Critique show that FedFormer performs better while still abiding by the privacy constraints of federated learning. In addition, we demonstrate nearly linear improvements in effectiveness with increased agent pools in certain tasks. This is contrasted by FedAvg, which fails to make noticeable improvements when scaled.

 - **Abstract**
 Programming-based Pre-trained Language Models (PPLMs) such as CodeBERT have achieved great success in many downstream code-related tasks. Since the memory and computational complexity of self-attention in the Transformer grow quadratically with the sequence length, PPLMs typically limit the code length to 512. However, codes in real-world applications are generally long, such as code searches, which cannot be processed efficiently by existing PPLMs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present SASA, a Structure-Aware Sparse Attention mechanism, which reduces the complexity and improves performance for long code understanding tasks. The key components in SASA are top-$k$ sparse attention and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based structure-aware attention. With top-$k$ sparse attention, the most crucial attention relation can be obtained with a lower computational cost. As the code structure represents the logic of the code statements, which is a complement to the code sequence characteristics, we further introduce AST structures into attention. Extensive experiments on CodeXGLUE tasks show that SASA achieves better performance than the competing baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 Intelligent systems designed for play-based interactions should be contextually aware of the users and their surroundings. Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) are critical for these interactive agents to carry out effective goal-oriented communication with users in real-time. For the real-world (i.e., in-the-wild) deployment of such conversational agents, improving the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module of the goal-oriented SDS pipeline is crucial, especially with limited task-specific datasets. This study explores the potential benefits of a recently proposed transformer-based multi-task NLU architecture, mainly to perform Intent Recognition on small-size domain-specific educational game datasets. The evaluation datasets were collected from children practicing basic math concepts via play-based interactions in game-based learning settings. We investigate the NLU performances on the initial proof-of-concept game datasets versus the real-world deployment datasets and observe anticipated performance drops in-the-wild. We have shown that compared to the more straightforward baseline approaches, Dual Intent and Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture is robust enough to handle real-world data to a large extent for the Intent Recognition task on these domain-specific in-the-wild game datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families address these problems and show potential to eventually bridge the performance gap. We introduce Tranception, a novel transformer architecture leveraging autoregressive predictions and retrieval of homologous sequences at inference to achieve state-of-the-art fitness prediction performance. Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants, robustness to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach offers significant gain of scope over existing approaches. To enable more rigorous model testing across a broader range of protein families, we develop ProteinGym -- an extensive set of multiplexed assays of variant effects, substantially increasing both the number and diversity of assays compared to existing benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformers have become one of the most important models for computer vision tasks. Although they outperform prior works, they require heavy computational resources on a scale that is quadratic to the number of tokens, $N$. This is a major drawback of the traditional self-attention (SA) algorithm. Here, we propose the X-ViT, ViT with a novel SA mechanism that has linear complexity. The main approach of this work is to eliminate nonlinearity from the original SA. We factorize the matrix multiplication of the SA mechanism without complicated linear approximation. By modifying only a few lines of code from the original SA, the proposed models outperform most transformer-based models on image classification and dense prediction tasks on most capacity regimes.
### Transformers from an Optimization Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning models such as the Transformer are often constructed by heuristics and experience. To provide a complementary foundation, in this work we study the following problem: Is it possible to find an energy function underlying the Transformer model, such that descent steps along this energy correspond with the Transformer forward pass? By finding such a function, we can reinterpret Transformers as the unfolding of an interpretable optimization process across iterations. This unfolding perspective has been frequently adopted in the past to elucidate more straightforward deep models such as MLPs and CNNs; however, it has thus far remained elusive obtaining a similar equivalence for more complex models with self-attention mechanisms like the Transformer. To this end, we first outline several major obstacles before providing companion techniques to at least partially address them, demonstrating for the first time a close association between energy function minimization and deep layers with self-attention. This interpretation contributes to our intuition and understanding of Transformers, while potentially laying the ground-work for new model designs.

 - **Abstract**
 Faced with problems of increasing complexity, recent research in Bayesian Optimisation (BO) has focused on adapting deep probabilistic models as flexible alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs). In a similar vein, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing state-of-the-art probabilistic transformers in BO. Upon further investigation, we observe two drawbacks stemming from their training procedure and loss definition, hindering their direct deployment as proxies in black-box optimisation. First, we notice that these models are trained on uniformly distributed inputs, which impairs predictive accuracy on non-uniform data - a setting arising from any typical BO loop due to exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Second, we realise that training losses (e.g., cross-entropy) only asymptotically guarantee accurate posterior approximations, i.e., after arriving at the global optimum, which generally cannot be ensured. At the stationary points of the loss function, however, we observe a degradation in predictive performance especially in exploratory regions of the input space. To tackle these shortcomings we introduce two components: 1) a BO-tailored training prior supporting non-uniformly distributed points, and 2) a novel approximate posterior regulariser trading-off accuracy and input sensitivity to filter favourable stationary points for improved predictive performance. In a large panel of experiments, we demonstrate, for the first time, that one transformer pre-trained on data sampled from random GP priors produces competitive results on 16 benchmark black-boxes compared to GP-based BO. Since our model is only pre-trained once and used in all tasks without any retraining and/or fine-tuning, we report an order of magnitude time-reduction, while matching and sometimes outperforming GPs.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new representation for encoding 3D shapes as neural fields. The representation is designed to be compatible with the transformer architecture and to benefit both shape reconstruction and shape generation. Existing works on neural fields are grid-based representations with latents defined on a regular grid. In contrast, we define latents on irregular grids, enabling our representation to be sparse and adaptive. In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, our shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. For shape generation, our representation promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models. We show different applications that improve over the current state of the art. First, we show results for probabilistic shape reconstruction from a single higher resolution image. Second, we train a probabilistic model conditioned on very low resolution images. Third, we apply our model to category-conditioned generation. All probabilistic experiments confirm that we are able to generate detailed and high quality shapes to yield the new state of the art in generative 3D shape modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Our world is ambiguous and this is reflected in the data we use to train our algorithms. This is especially true when we try to model natural processes where collected data is affected by noisy measurements and differences in measurement techniques. Sometimes, the process itself can be ambiguous, such as in the case of RNA folding, where a single nucleotide sequence can fold into multiple structures. This ambiguity suggests that a predictive model should have similar probabilistic characteristics to match the data it models. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical latent distribution to enhance one of the most successful deep learning models, the Transformer, to accommodate ambiguities and data distributions. We show the benefits of our approach on a synthetic task, with state-of-the-art results in RNA folding, and demonstrate its generative capabilities on property-based molecule design, outperforming existing work.

 - **Abstract**
 Masked image modeling (MIM), an emerging self-supervised pre-training method, has shown impressive success across numerous downstream vision tasks with Vision transformers (ViT). Its underlying idea is simple: a portion of the input image is randomly masked out and then reconstructed via the pre-text task. However, why MIM works well is not well explained, and previous studies insist that MIM primarily works for the Transformer family but is incompatible with CNNs. In this paper, we first study interactions among patches to understand what knowledge is learned and how it is acquired via the MIM task. We observe that MIM essentially teaches the model to learn better middle-level interactions among patches and extract more generalized features. Based on this fact, we propose an Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling framework (A$^2$MIM), which is compatible with not only Transformers but also CNNs in a unified way. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our A$^2$MIM learns better representations and endows the backbone model with the stronger capability to transfer to various downstream tasks for both Transformers and CNNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recipe recommendation systems play an essential role in helping people decide what to eat. Existing recipe recommendation systems typically focused on content-based or collaborative filtering approaches, ignoring the higher-order collaborative signal such as relational structure information among users, recipes and food items. In this paper, we formalize the problem of recipe recommendation with graphs to incorporate the collaborative signal into recipe recommendation through graph modeling. In particular, we first present URI-Graph, a new and large-scale user-recipe-ingredient graph. We then propose RecipeRec, a novel heterogeneous graph learning model for recipe recommendation. The proposed model can capture recipe content and collaborative signal through a heterogeneous graph neural network with hierarchical attention and an ingredient set transformer. We also introduce a graph contrastive augmentation strategy to extract informative graph knowledge in a self-supervised manner. Finally, we design a joint objective function of recommendation and contrastive learning to optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RecipeRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods for recipe recommendation. Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/meettyj/RecipeRec.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have made progress in miscellaneous tasks, but suffer from quadratic computational and memory complexities. Recent works propose sparse Transformers with attention on sparse graphs to reduce complexity and remain strong performance. While effective, the crucial parts of how dense a graph needs to be to perform well are not fully explored. In this paper, we propose Normalized Information Payload (NIP), a graph scoring function measuring information transfer on graph, which provides an analysis tool for trade-offs between performance and complexity. Guided by this theoretical analysis, we present Hypercube Transformer, a sparse Transformer that models token interactions in a hypercube and shows comparable or even better results with vanilla Transformer while yielding $O(N\log N)$ complexity with sequence length $N$. Experiments on tasks requiring various sequence lengths lay validation for our graph function well.
### Future Transformer for Long-term Action Anticipation

 - **Abstract**
 The task of predicting future actions from a video is crucial for a real-world agent interacting with others. When anticipating actions in the distant future, we humans typically consider long-term relations over the whole sequence of actions, i.e., not only observed actions in the past but also potential actions in the future. In a similar spirit, we propose an end-to-end attention model for action anticipation, dubbed Future Transformer (FUTR), that leverages global attention over all input frames and output tokens to predict a minutes-long sequence of future actions. Unlike the previous autoregressive models, the proposed method learns to predict the whole sequence of future actions in parallel decoding, enabling more accurate and fast inference for long-term anticipation. We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks for long-term action anticipation, Breakfast and 50 Salads, achieving state-of-the-art results.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces contrastive siamese (c-siam) network, an architecture for leveraging unlabeled acoustic data in speech recognition. c-siam is the first network that extracts high-level linguistic information from speech by matching outputs of two identical transformer encoders. It contains augmented and target branches which are trained by: (1) masking inputs and matching outputs with a contrastive loss, (2) incorporating a stop gradient operation on the target branch, (3) using an extra learnable transformation on the augmented branch, (4) introducing new temporal augment functions to prevent the shortcut learning problem. We use the Libri-light 60k unsupervised data and the LibriSpeech 100hrs/960hrs supervised data to compare c-siam and other best-performing systems. Our experiments show that c-siam provides 20% relative word error rate improvement over wav2vec baselines. A c-siam network with 450M parameters achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art networks with 600M parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Unsupervised object-centric learning aims to represent the modular, compositional, and causal structure of a scene as a set of object representations and thereby promises to resolve many critical limitations of traditional single-vector representations such as poor systematic generalization. Although there have been many remarkable advances in recent years, one of the most critical problems in this direction has been that previous methods work only with simple and synthetic scenes but not with complex and naturalistic images or videos. In this paper, we propose STEVE, an unsupervised model for object-centric learning in videos. Our proposed model makes a significant advancement by demonstrating its effectiveness on various complex and naturalistic videos unprecedented in this line of research. Interestingly, this is achieved by neither adding complexity to the model architecture nor introducing a new objective or weak supervision. Rather, it is achieved by a surprisingly simple architecture that uses a transformer-based image decoder conditioned on slots and the learning objective is simply to reconstruct the observation. Our experiment results on various complex and naturalistic videos show significant improvements compared to the previous state-of-the-art.
### Patching Leaks in the Charformer for Efficient Character-Level  Generation

 - **Abstract**
 Character-based representations have important advantages over subword-based ones for morphologically rich languages. They come with increased robustness to noisy input and do not need a separate tokenization step. However, they also have a crucial disadvantage: they notably increase the length of text sequences. The GBST method from Charformer groups (aka downsamples) characters to solve this, but allows information to leak when applied to a Transformer decoder. We solve this information leak issue, thereby enabling character grouping in the decoder. We show that Charformer downsampling has no apparent benefits in NMT over previous downsampling methods in terms of translation quality, however it can be trained roughly 30% faster. Promising performance on English--Turkish translation indicate the potential of character-level models for morphologically-rich languages.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional layers within graph neural networks operate by aggregating information about local neighbourhood structures; one common way to encode such substructures is through random walks. The distribution of these random walks evolves according to a diffusion equation defined using the graph Laplacian. We extend this approach by leveraging classic mathematical results about hypo-elliptic diffusions. This results in a novel tensor-valued graph operator, which we call the hypo-elliptic graph Laplacian. We provide theoretical guarantees and efficient low-rank approximation algorithms. In particular, this gives a structured approach to capture long-range dependencies on graphs that is robust to pooling. Besides the attractive theoretical properties, our experiments show that this method competes with graph transformers on datasets requiring long-range reasoning but scales only linearly in the number of edges as opposed to quadratically in nodes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we design and train a Generative Image-to-text Transformer, GIT, to unify vision-language tasks such as image/video captioning and question answering. While generative models provide a consistent network architecture between pre-training and fine-tuning, existing work typically contains complex structures (uni/multi-modal encoder/decoder) and depends on external modules such as object detectors/taggers and optical character recognition (OCR). In GIT, we simplify the architecture as one image encoder and one text decoder under a single language modeling task. We also scale up the pre-training data and the model size to boost the model performance. Without bells and whistles, our GIT establishes new state of the arts on 12 challenging benchmarks with a large margin. For instance, our model surpasses the human performance for the first time on TextCaps (138.2 vs. 125.5 in CIDEr). Furthermore, we present a new scheme of generation-based image classification and scene text recognition, achieving decent performance on standard benchmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).

 - **Abstract**
 Masked image modeling (MIM) learns representations with remarkably good fine-tuning performances, overshadowing previous prevalent pre-training approaches such as image classification, instance contrastive learning, and image-text alignment. In this paper, we show that the inferior fine-tuning performance of these pre-training approaches can be significantly improved by a simple post-processing in the form of feature distillation (FD). The feature distillation converts the old representations to new representations that have a few desirable properties just like those representations produced by MIM. These properties, which we aggregately refer to as optimization friendliness, are identified and analyzed by a set of attention- and optimization-related diagnosis tools. With these properties, the new representations show strong fine-tuning performance. Specifically, the contrastive self-supervised learning methods are made as competitive in fine-tuning as the state-of-the-art masked image modeling (MIM) algorithms. The CLIP models' fine-tuning performance is also significantly improved, with a CLIP ViT-L model reaching 89.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification. More importantly, our work provides a way for the future research to focus more effort on the generality and scalability of the learnt representations without being pre-occupied with optimization friendliness since it can be enhanced rather easily. The code will be available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Feature-Distillation.
