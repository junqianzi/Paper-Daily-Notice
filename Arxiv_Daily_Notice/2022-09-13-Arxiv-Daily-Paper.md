 - **Abstract**
 Place recognition is the fundamental module that can assist Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in loop-closure detection and re-localization for long-term navigation. The place recognition community has made astonishing progress over the last $20$ years, and this has attracted widespread research interest and application in multiple fields such as computer vision and robotics. However, few methods have shown promising place recognition performance in complex real-world scenarios, where long-term and large-scale appearance changes usually result in failures. Additionally, there is a lack of an integrated framework amongst the state-of-the-art methods that can handle all of the challenges in place recognition, which include appearance changes, viewpoint differences, robustness to unknown areas, and efficiency in real-world applications. In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that target long-term localization and discuss future directions and opportunities. We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition in long-term autonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments. We then review the recent works in place recognition for different sensor modalities and current strategies for dealing with various place recognition challenges. Finally, we review the existing datasets for long-term localization and introduce our datasets and evaluation API for different approaches. This paper can be a tutorial for researchers new to the place recognition community and those who care about long-term robotics autonomy. We also provide our opinion on the frequently asked question in robotics: Do robots need accurate localization for long-term autonomy? A summary of this work and our datasets and evaluation API is publicly available to the robotics community at: https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPRS.

 - **Abstract**
 Loop closure is an important component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Large Field-of-View (FoV) cameras have received extensive attention in the SLAM field as they can exploit more surrounding features on the panoramic image. In large-FoV VIO, for incorporating the informative cues located on the negative plane of the panoramic lens, image features are represented by a three-dimensional vector with a unit length. While the panoramic FoV is seemingly advantageous for loop closure, the benefits cannot easily be materialized under large-attitude-angle differences, where loop-closure frames can hardly be matched by existing methods. In this work, to fully unleash the potential of ultra-wide FoV, we propose to leverage the attitude information of a VIO system to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To tackle this issue, we propose a loop closure framework with a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation, to improve the accuracy of LF-VIO. On the public PALVIO dataset, a comprehensive set of experiments is carried out and the proposed LF-VIO-Loop outperforms state-of-the-art visual-inertial-odometry methods. Our code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/flysoaryun/LF-VIO-Loop.

 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental problems in autonomous mobile robots where a robot needs to reconstruct a previously unseen environment while simultaneously localising itself with respect to the map. In particular, Visual-SLAM uses various sensors from the mobile robot for collecting and sensing a representation of the map. Traditionally, geometric model-based techniques were used to tackle the SLAM problem, which tends to be error-prone under challenging environments. Recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning techniques, have provided a data-driven approach to tackle the Visual-SLAM problem. This review summarises recent advancements in the Visual-SLAM domain using various learning-based methods. We begin by providing a concise overview of the geometric model-based approaches, followed by technical reviews on the current paradigms in SLAM. Then, we present the various learning-based approaches to collecting sensory inputs from mobile robots and performing scene understanding. The current paradigms in deep-learning-based semantic understanding are discussed and placed under the context of Visual-SLAM. Finally, we discuss challenges and further opportunities in the direction of learning-based approaches in Visual-SLAM.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the scene, which explicitly describes the distance and the direction of each point's movement. Scene flow estimation is used in various applications such as autonomous driving fields, activity recognition, and virtual reality fields. As it is challenging to annotate scene flow with ground truth for real-world data, this leaves no real-world dataset available to provide a large amount of data with ground truth for scene flow estimation. Therefore, many works use synthesized data to pre-train their network and real-world LiDAR data to finetune. Unlike the previous unsupervised learning of scene flow in point clouds, we propose to use odometry information to assist the unsupervised learning of scene flow and use real-world LiDAR data to train our network. Supervised odometry provides more accurate shared cost volume for scene flow. In addition, the proposed network has mask-weighted warp layers to get a more accurate predicted point cloud. The warp operation means applying an estimated pose transformation or scene flow to a source point cloud to obtain a predicted point cloud and is the key to refining scene flow from coarse to fine. When performing warp operations, the points in different states use different weights for the pose transformation and scene flow transformation. We classify the states of points as static, dynamic, and occluded, where the static masks are used to divide static and dynamic points, and the occlusion masks are used to divide occluded points. The mask-weighted warp layer indicates that static masks and occlusion masks are used as weights when performing warp operations. Our designs are proved to be effective in ablation experiments. The experiment results show the promising prospect of an odometry-assisted unsupervised learning method for 3D scene flow in real-world data.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern autonomous vehicles rely heavily on mechanical LiDARs for perception. Current perception methods generally require 360{\deg} point clouds, collected sequentially as the LiDAR scans the azimuth and acquires consecutive wedge-shaped slices. The acquisition latency of a full scan (~ 100ms) may lead to outdated perception which is detrimental to safe operation. Recent streaming perception works proposed directly processing LiDAR slices and compensating for the narrow field of view (FOV) of a slice by reusing features from preceding slices. These works, however, are all based on a single modality and require past information which may be outdated. Meanwhile, images from high-frequency cameras can support streaming models as they provide a larger FoV compared to a LiDAR slice. However, this difference in FoV complicates sensor fusion. To address this research gap, we propose an innovative camera-LiDAR streaming 3D object detection framework that uses camera images instead of past LiDAR slices to provide an up-to-date, dense, and wide context for streaming perception. The proposed method outperforms prior streaming models on the challenging NuScenes benchmark. It also outperforms powerful full-scan detectors while being much faster. Our method is shown to be robust to missing camera images, narrow LiDAR slices, and small camera-LiDAR miscalibration.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates a new method to model and control variable-frequency power converters in a switching-synchronized sampled-state space for cycle-by-cycle digital control. There are a number of significant benefits in comparison to other methods including fast dynamic performance together with ease of design and implementation. Theoretical results are presented and verified through hardware, and simulations of a current-mode buck converter with constant on-time and a current-mode boost converter with constant off-time. Dynamic voltage scaling for microprocessors and LiDAR are among the applications that can benefit.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning powerful representations in bird's-eye-view (BEV) for perception tasks is trending and drawing extensive attention both from industry and academia. Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms perform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective view. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source information from different sensors and representing features in a unified view come of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as representing surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and representing objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in planning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to reconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective view to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how to formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and views; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations vary across different scenarios. In this survey, we review the most recent work on BEV perception and provide an in-depth analysis of different solutions. Moreover, several systematic designs of BEV approach from the industry are depicted as well. Furthermore, we introduce a full suite of practical guidebook to improve the performance of BEV perception tasks, including camera, LiDAR and fusion inputs. At last, we point out the future research directions in this area. We hope this report would shed some light on the community and encourage more research effort on BEV perception. We keep an active repository to collect the most recent work and provide a toolbox for bag of tricks at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/BEVPerception-Survey-Recipe.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.05277
 - **Abstract**
 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve photo-realistic view synthesis with densely captured input images. However, the geometry of NeRF is extremely under-constrained given sparse views, resulting in significant degradation of novel view synthesis quality. Inspired by self-supervised depth estimation methods, we propose StructNeRF, a solution to novel view synthesis for indoor scenes with sparse inputs. StructNeRF leverages the structural hints naturally embedded in multi-view inputs to handle the unconstrained geometry issue in NeRF. Specifically, it tackles the texture and non-texture regions respectively: a patch-based multi-view consistent photometric loss is proposed to constrain the geometry of textured regions; for non-textured ones, we explicitly restrict them to be 3D consistent planes. Through the dense self-supervised depth constraints, our method improves both the geometry and the view synthesis performance of NeRF without any additional training on external data. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that StructNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art methods for indoor scenes with sparse inputs both quantitatively and qualitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 Common data models solve many challenges of standardizing electronic health record (EHR) data, but are unable to semantically integrate the resources needed for deep phenotyping. Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontologies provide semantically computable representations of biological knowledge and enable the integration of a variety of biomedical data. However, mapping EHR data to OBO Foundry ontologies requires significant manual curation and domain expertise. We introduce a framework for mapping Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard vocabularies to OBO Foundry ontologies. Using this framework, we produced mappings for 92,367 conditions, 8,615 drug ingredients, and 10,673 measurement results. Mapping accuracy was verified by domain experts and when examined across 24 hospitals, the mappings covered 99% of conditions and drug ingredients and 68% of measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that OMOP2OBO mappings can aid in the systematic identification of undiagnosed rare disease patients who might benefit from genetic testing.

 - **Abstract**
 Graph embedding methods aim at finding useful graph representations by mapping nodes to a low-dimensional vector space. It is a task with important downstream applications, such as link prediction, graph reconstruction, data visualization, node classification, and language modeling. In recent years, the field of graph embedding has witnessed a shift from linear algebraic approaches towards local, gradient-based optimization methods combined with random walks and deep neural networks to tackle the problem of embedding large graphs. However, despite this improvement in the optimization tools, graph embedding methods are still generically designed in a way that is oblivious to the particularities of real-life networks. Indeed, there has been significant progress in understanding and modeling complex real-life networks in recent years. However, the obtained results have had a minor influence on the development of graph embedding algorithms. This paper aims to remedy this by designing a graph embedding method that takes advantage of recent valuable insights from the field of network science. More precisely, we present a novel graph embedding approach based on the popularity-similarity and local attraction paradigms. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on the link prediction task on a large number of real-life networks. We show, using extensive experimental analysis, that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms. We also demonstrate its robustness to data scarcity and the choice of embedding dimensionality.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomaly detection on the attributed network has recently received increasing attention in many research fields, such as cybernetic anomaly detection and financial fraud detection. With the wide application of deep learning on graph representations, existing approaches choose to apply euclidean graph encoders as their backbone, which may lose important hierarchical information, especially in complex networks. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient anomaly detection framework using hyperbolic self-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we first conduct the data augmentation by performing subgraph sampling. Then we utilize the hierarchical information in hyperbolic space through exponential mapping and logarithmic mapping and obtain the anomaly score by subtracting scores of the positive pairs from the negative pairs via a discriminating process. Finally, extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach performs superior over representative baseline approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Deploying machine learning models on mobile devices has gained increasing attention. To tackle the model generalization problem with the limitations of hardware resources on the device, the device model needs to be lightweight by techniques such as model compression from the cloud model. However, the major obstacle to improve the device model generalization is the distribution shift between the data of cloud and device models, since the data distribution on device model often changes over time (e.g., users might have different preferences in recommendation system). Although real-time fine-tuning and distillation method take this situation into account, these methods require on-device training, which are practically infeasible due to the low computational power and a lack of real-time labeled samples on the device. In this paper, we propose a novel task-agnostic framework, named MetaNetwork, for generating adaptive device model parameters from cloud without on-device training. Specifically, our MetaNetwork is deployed on cloud and consists of MetaGenerator and MetaStabilizer modules. The MetaGenerator is designed to learn a mapping function from samples to model parameters, and it can generate and deliver the adaptive parameters to the device based on samples uploaded from the device to the cloud. The MetaStabilizer aims to reduce the oscillation of the MetaGenerator, accelerate the convergence and improve the model performance during both training and inference. We evaluate our method on two tasks with three datasets. Extensive experiments show that MetaNetwork can achieve competitive performances in different modalities.

 - **Abstract**
 Given a polygon $W$, a depth sensor placed at point $p=(x,y)$ inside $W$ and oriented in direction $\theta$ measures the distance $d=h(x,y,\theta)$ between $p$ and the closest point on the boundary of $W$ along a ray emanating from $p$ in direction $\theta$. We study the following problem: Give a polygon $W$, possibly with holes, with $n$ vertices, preprocess it such that given a query real value $d\geq 0$, one can efficiently compute the preimage $h^{-1}(d)$, namely determine all the possible poses (positions and orientations) of a depth sensor placed in $W$ that would yield the reading $d$. We employ a decomposition of $W\times S^1$, which is an extension of the celebrated trapezoidal decomposition, and which we call rotational trapezoidal decomposition and present an efficient data structure, which computes the preimage in an output-sensitive fashion relative to this decomposition: if $k$ cells of the decomposition contribute to the final result, we will report them in $O(k+1)$ time, after $O(n^2\log n)$ preprocessing time and using $O(n^2)$ storage space. We also analyze the shape of the projection of the preimage onto the polygon $W$; this projection describes the portion of $W$ where the sensor could have been placed. Furthermore, we obtain analogous results for the more useful case (narrowing down the set of possible poses), where the sensor performs two depth measurement from the same point $p$, one in direction $\theta$ and the other in direction $\theta+\pi$. While localizations problems in robotics are often carried out by exploring the full visibility polygon of a sensor placed at a fixed point of the environment, the approach that we propose here opens the door to sufficing with only few depth measurements, which is advantageous as it allows for usage of inexpensive sensors and could also lead to savings in storage and communication costs.

 - **Abstract**
 In emergency scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed to assist localization and communication services for ground terminals. In this paper, we propose a new integrated air-ground networking paradigm that uses dual-functional UAVs to assist the ground networks for improving both communication and localization performance. We investigate the optimization problem of deploying the minimal number of UAVs to satisfy the communication and localization requirements of ground users. The problem has several technical difficulties including the cardinality minimization, the non-convexity of localization performance metric regarding UAV location, and the association between user and communication terminal. To tackle the difficulties, we adopt D-optimality as the localization performance metric, and derive the geometric characteristics of the feasible UAV hovering regions in 2D and 3D based on accurate approximation values. We solve the simplified 2D projection deployment problem by transforming the problem into a minimum hitting set problem, and propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve it. Through numerical simulations, we compare our proposed algorithm with benchmark methods. The number of UAVs required by the proposed algorithm is close to the optimal solution, while other benchmark methods require much more UAVs to accomplish the same task.

 - **Abstract**
 Loop closure is an important component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Large Field-of-View (FoV) cameras have received extensive attention in the SLAM field as they can exploit more surrounding features on the panoramic image. In large-FoV VIO, for incorporating the informative cues located on the negative plane of the panoramic lens, image features are represented by a three-dimensional vector with a unit length. While the panoramic FoV is seemingly advantageous for loop closure, the benefits cannot easily be materialized under large-attitude-angle differences, where loop-closure frames can hardly be matched by existing methods. In this work, to fully unleash the potential of ultra-wide FoV, we propose to leverage the attitude information of a VIO system to guide the feature point detection of the loop closure. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To tackle this issue, we propose a loop closure framework with a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation, to improve the accuracy of LF-VIO. On the public PALVIO dataset, a comprehensive set of experiments is carried out and the proposed LF-VIO-Loop outperforms state-of-the-art visual-inertial-odometry methods. Our code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/flysoaryun/LF-VIO-Loop.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we develop a posteriori error control for a generalized Boussinesq model in which thermal conductivity and viscosity are temperature-dependent. Therein, the stationary Navier-Stokes equations are coupled with a stationary heat equation. The coupled problem is modeled and solved in a monolithic fashion. The focus is on multigoal-oriented error estimation with the dual-weighted residual method in which an adjoint problem is utilized to obtain sensitivity measures with respect to several goal functionals. The error localization is achieved with the help of a partition-of-unity in a weak formulation, which is specifically convenient for coupled problems as we have at hand. The error indicators are used to employ adaptive algorithms, which are substantiated with several numerical tests such as one benchmark and two further experiments that are motivated from laser material processing. Therein, error reductions and effectivity indices are consulted to establish the robustness and efficiency of our framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Inertial-aided systems require continuous motion excitation among other reasons to characterize the measurement biases that will enable accurate integration required for localization frameworks. This paper proposes the use of informative path planning to find the best trajectory for minimizing the uncertainty of IMU biases and an adaptive traces method to guide the planner towards trajectories which aid convergence. The key contribution is a novel regression method based on Gaussian Process (GP) to enforce continuity and differentiability between waypoints from a variant of the RRT* planning algorithm. We employ linear operators applied to the GP kernel function to infer not only continuous position trajectories, but also velocities and accelerations. The use of linear functionals enable velocity and acceleration constraints given by the IMU measurements to be imposed on the position GP model. The results from both simulation and real world experiments show that planning for IMU bias convergence helps minimize localization errors in state estimation frameworks.

### Gluformer: Transformer-Based Personalized Glucose Forecasting with  Uncertainty Quantification

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning models achieve state-of-the art results in predicting blood glucose trajectories, with a wide range of architectures being proposed. However, the adaptation of such models in clinical practice is slow, largely due to the lack of uncertainty quantification of provided predictions. In this work, we propose to model the future glucose trajectory conditioned on the past as an infinite mixture of basis distributions (i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, etc.). This change allows us to learn the uncertainty and predict more accurately in the cases when the trajectory has a heterogeneous or multi-modal distribution. To estimate the parameters of the predictive distribution, we utilize the Transformer architecture. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of accuracy and uncertainty on the synthetic and benchmark glucose data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple object tracking gained a lot of interest from researchers in recent years, and it has become one of the trending problems in computer vision, especially with the recent advancement of autonomous driving. MOT is one of the critical vision tasks for different issues like occlusion in crowded scenes, similar appearance, small object detection difficulty, ID switching, etc. To tackle these challenges, as researchers tried to utilize the attention mechanism of transformer, interrelation of tracklets with graph convolutional neural network, appearance similarity of objects in different frames with the siamese network, they also tried simple IOU matching based CNN network, motion prediction with LSTM. To take these scattered techniques under an umbrella, we have studied more than a hundred papers published over the last three years and have tried to extract the techniques that are more focused on by researchers in recent times to solve the problems of MOT. We have enlisted numerous applications, possibilities, and how MOT can be related to real life. Our review has tried to show the different perspectives of techniques that researchers used overtimes and give some future direction for the potential researchers. Moreover, we have included popular benchmark datasets and metrics in this review.

 - **Abstract**
 Healthcare workers such as doctors and nurses are expected to be trustworthy and creditable sources of vaccine-related information. Their opinions toward the COVID-19 vaccines may influence the vaccination uptake among the general population. However, vaccine hesitancy is still an important issue even among the healthcare workers. Therefore, it is critical to understand their opinions to help reduce the level of vaccine hesitancy. There have been studies examining healthcare workers' viewpoints on COVID-19 vaccines using questionnaires. Reportedly, a considerably higher proportion of vaccine hesitancy is observed among nurses, compared to doctors. We intend to verify and study this phenomenon at a much larger scale and in fine grain using social media data, which has been effectively and efficiently leveraged by researchers to address real-world issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we use a keyword search to identify healthcare workers and further classify them into doctors and nurses from the profile descriptions of the corresponding Twitter users. Moreover, we apply a transformer-based language model to remove irrelevant tweets. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling are employed to analyze and compare the sentiment and thematic differences in the tweets posted by doctors and nurses. We find that doctors are overall more positive toward the COVID-19 vaccines. The focuses of doctors and nurses when they discuss vaccines in a negative way are in general different. Doctors are more concerned with the effectiveness of the vaccines over newer variants while nurses pay more attention to the potential side effects on children. Therefore, we suggest that more customized strategies should be deployed when communicating with different groups of healthcare workers.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer architectures have led to remarkable progress in many state-of-art applications. However, despite their successes, modern transformers rely on the self-attention mechanism, whose time- and space-complexity is quadratic in the length of the input. Several approaches have been proposed to speed up self-attention mechanisms to achieve sub-quadratic running time; however, the large majority of these works are not accompanied by rigorous error guarantees. In this work, we establish lower bounds on the computational complexity of self-attention in a number of scenarios. We prove that the time complexity of self-attention is necessarily quadratic in the input length, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. This argument holds even if the attention computation is performed only approximately, and for a variety of attention mechanisms. As a complement to our lower bounds, we show that it is indeed possible to approximate dot-product self-attention using finite Taylor series in linear-time, at the cost of having an exponential dependence on the polynomial order.

 - **Abstract**
 In human environments, robots are expected to accomplish a variety of manipulation tasks given simple natural language instructions. Yet, robotic manipulation is extremely challenging as it requires fine-grained motor control, long-term memory as well as generalization to previously unseen tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we propose a unified transformer-based approach that takes into account multiple inputs. In particular, our transformer architecture integrates (i) natural language instructions and (ii) multi-view scene observations while (iii) keeping track of the full history of observations and actions. Such an approach enables learning dependencies between history and instructions and improves manipulation precision using multiple views. We evaluate our method on the challenging RLBench benchmark and on a real-world robot. Notably, our approach scales to 74 diverse RLBench tasks and outperforms the state of the art. We also address instruction-conditioned tasks and demonstrate excellent generalization to previously unseen variations.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, significant progress has been made in transportation electrification. And lithium-ion batteries (LIB), as the main energy storage devices, have received widespread attention. Accurately predicting the state of health (SOH) can not only ease the anxiety of users about the battery life but also provide important information for the management of the battery. This paper presents a prediction method for SOH based on Vision Transformer (ViT) model. First, discrete charging data of a predefined voltage range is used as an input data matrix. Then, the cycle features of the battery are captured by the ViT which can obtain the global features, and the SOH is obtained by combining the cycle features with the full connection (FC) layer. At the same time, transfer learning (TL) is introduced, and the prediction model based on source task battery training is further fine-tuned according to the early cycle data of the target task battery to provide an accurate prediction. Experiments show that our method can obtain better feature expression compared with existing deep learning methods so that better prediction effect and transfer effect can be achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Deepfake has drawn considerable public attention due to security and privacy concerns in social media digital forensics. As the wildly spreading Deepfake videos on the Internet become more realistic, traditional detection techniques have failed in distinguishing between the real and fake. Most existing deep learning methods mainly focus on local features and relations within the face image using convolutional neural networks as a backbone. However, local features and relations are insufficient for model training to learn enough general information for Deepfake detection. Therefore, the existing Deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck to further improving the detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a deep convolutional Transformer to incorporate the decisive image features both locally and globally. Specifically, we apply convolutional pooling and re-attention to enrich the extracted features and enhance the efficacy. Moreover, we employ the barely discussed image keyframes in model training for performance improvement and visualize the feature quantity gap between the key and normal image frames caused by video compression. We finally illustrate the transferability with extensive experiments on several Deepfake benchmark datasets. The proposed solution consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on both within- and cross-dataset experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 FP8 is a natural progression for accelerating deep learning training inference beyond the 16-bit formats common in modern processors. In this paper we propose an 8-bit floating point (FP8) binary interchange format consisting of two encodings - E4M3 (4-bit exponent and 3-bit mantissa) and E5M2 (5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa). While E5M2 follows IEEE 754 conventions for representatio of special values, E4M3's dynamic range is extended by not representing infinities and having only one mantissa bit-pattern for NaNs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the FP8 format on a variety of image and language tasks, effectively matching the result quality achieved by 16-bit training sessions. Our study covers the main modern neural network architectures - CNNs, RNNs, and Transformer-based models, leaving all the hyperparameters unchanged from the 16-bit baseline training sessions. Our training experiments include large, up to 175B parameter, language models. We also examine FP8 post-training-quantization of language models trained using 16-bit formats that resisted fixed point int8 quantization.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have revolutionized vision and natural language processing with their ability to scale with large datasets. But in robotic manipulation, data is both limited and expensive. Can we still benefit from Transformers with the right problem formulation? We investigate this question with PerAct, a language-conditioned behavior-cloning agent for multi-task 6-DoF manipulation. PerAct encodes language goals and RGB-D voxel observations with a Perceiver Transformer, and outputs discretized actions by "detecting the next best voxel action". Unlike frameworks that operate on 2D images, the voxelized observation and action space provides a strong structural prior for efficiently learning 6-DoF policies. With this formulation, we train a single multi-task Transformer for 18 RLBench tasks (with 249 variations) and 7 real-world tasks (with 18 variations) from just a few demonstrations per task. Our results show that PerAct significantly outperforms unstructured image-to-action agents and 3D ConvNet baselines for a wide range of tabletop tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently introduced transformer-based article encoders (TAEs) designed to produce similar vector representations for mutually related scientific articles have demonstrated strong performance on benchmark datasets for scientific article recommendation. However, the existing benchmark datasets are predominantly focused on single domains and, in some cases, contain easy negatives in small candidate pools. Evaluating representations on such benchmarks might obscure the realistic performance of TAEs in setups with thousands of articles in candidate pools. In this work, we evaluate TAEs on large benchmarks with more challenging candidate pools. We compare the performance of TAEs with a lexical retrieval baseline model BM25 on the task of citation recommendation, where the model produces a list of recommendations for citing in a given input article. We find out that BM25 is still very competitive with the state-of-the-art neural retrievers, a finding which is surprising given the strong performance of TAEs on small benchmarks. As a remedy for the limitations of the existing benchmarks, we propose a new benchmark dataset for evaluating scientific article representations: Multi-Domain Citation Recommendation dataset (MDCR), which covers different scientific fields and contains challenging candidate pools.

 - **Abstract**
 Choosing an appropriate parameter set for the designed controller is critical for the final performance but usually requires a tedious and careful tuning process, which implies a strong need for automatic tuning methods. However, among existing methods, derivative-free ones suffer from poor scalability or low efficiency, while gradient-based ones are often unavailable due to possibly non-differentiable controller structure. To resolve the issues, we tackle the controller tuning problem using a novel derivative-free reinforcement learning (RL) framework, which performs timestep-wise perturbation in parameter space during experience collection and integrates derivative-free policy updates into the advanced actor-critic RL architecture to achieve high versatility and efficiency. To demonstrate the framework's efficacy, we conduct numerical experiments on two concrete examples from autonomous driving, namely, adaptive cruise control with PID controller and trajectory tracking with MPC controller. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms popular baselines and highlight its strong potential for controller tuning.

 - **Abstract**
 Scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the scene, which explicitly describes the distance and the direction of each point's movement. Scene flow estimation is used in various applications such as autonomous driving fields, activity recognition, and virtual reality fields. As it is challenging to annotate scene flow with ground truth for real-world data, this leaves no real-world dataset available to provide a large amount of data with ground truth for scene flow estimation. Therefore, many works use synthesized data to pre-train their network and real-world LiDAR data to finetune. Unlike the previous unsupervised learning of scene flow in point clouds, we propose to use odometry information to assist the unsupervised learning of scene flow and use real-world LiDAR data to train our network. Supervised odometry provides more accurate shared cost volume for scene flow. In addition, the proposed network has mask-weighted warp layers to get a more accurate predicted point cloud. The warp operation means applying an estimated pose transformation or scene flow to a source point cloud to obtain a predicted point cloud and is the key to refining scene flow from coarse to fine. When performing warp operations, the points in different states use different weights for the pose transformation and scene flow transformation. We classify the states of points as static, dynamic, and occluded, where the static masks are used to divide static and dynamic points, and the occlusion masks are used to divide occluded points. The mask-weighted warp layer indicates that static masks and occlusion masks are used as weights when performing warp operations. Our designs are proved to be effective in ablation experiments. The experiment results show the promising prospect of an odometry-assisted unsupervised learning method for 3D scene flow in real-world data.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning powerful representations in bird's-eye-view (BEV) for perception tasks is trending and drawing extensive attention both from industry and academia. Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms perform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective view. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source information from different sensors and representing features in a unified view come of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as representing surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and representing objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in planning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to reconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective view to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how to formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and views; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations vary across different scenarios. In this survey, we review the most recent work on BEV perception and provide an in-depth analysis of different solutions. Moreover, several systematic designs of BEV approach from the industry are depicted as well. Furthermore, we introduce a full suite of practical guidebook to improve the performance of BEV perception tasks, including camera, LiDAR and fusion inputs. At last, we point out the future research directions in this area. We hope this report would shed some light on the community and encourage more research effort on BEV perception. We keep an active repository to collect the most recent work and provide a toolbox for bag of tricks at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/BEVPerception-Survey-Recipe.
