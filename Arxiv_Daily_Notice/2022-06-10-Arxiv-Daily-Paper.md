 - **Abstract**
 Most pipelines for Augmented and Virtual Reality estimate the ego-motion of the camera by creating a map of sparse 3D landmarks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of depth completion, that is, densifying this sparse 3D map using RGB images as guidance. This remains a challenging problem due to the low density, non-uniform and outlier-prone 3D landmarks produced by SfM and SLAM pipelines. We introduce a transformer block, SparseFormer, that fuses 3D landmarks with deep visual features to produce dense depth. The SparseFormer has a global receptive field, making the module especially effective for depth completion with low-density and non-uniform landmarks. To address the issue of depth outliers among the 3D landmarks, we introduce a trainable refinement module that filters outliers through attention between the sparse landmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 A key challenge for autonomous vehicles is to navigate in unseen dynamic environments. Separating moving objects from static ones is essential for navigation, pose estimation, and understanding how other traffic participants are likely to move in the near future. In this work, we tackle the problem of distinguishing 3D LiDAR points that belong to currently moving objects, like walking pedestrians or driving cars, from points that are obtained from non-moving objects, like walls but also parked cars. Our approach takes a sequence of observed LiDAR scans and turns them into a voxelized sparse 4D point cloud. We apply computationally efficient sparse 4D convolutions to jointly extract spatial and temporal features and predict moving object confidence scores for all points in the sequence. We develop a receding horizon strategy that allows us to predict moving objects online and to refine predictions on the go based on new observations. We use a binary Bayes filter to recursively integrate new predictions of a scan resulting in more robust estimation. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI moving object segmentation challenge and show more accurate predictions than existing methods. Since our approach only operates on the geometric information of point clouds over time, it generalizes well to new, unseen environments, which we evaluate on the Apollo dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Comprehensive 3D scene understanding, both geometrically and semantically, is important for real-world applications such as robot perception. Most of the existing work has focused on developing data-driven discriminative models for scene understanding. This paper provides a new approach to scene understanding, from a synthesis model perspective, by leveraging the recent progress on implicit 3D representation and neural rendering. Building upon the great success of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), we introduce Scene-Property Synthesis with NeRF (SS-NeRF) that is able to not only render photo-realistic RGB images from novel viewpoints, but also render various accurate scene properties (e.g., appearance, geometry, and semantics). By doing so, we facilitate addressing a variety of scene understanding tasks under a unified framework, including semantic segmentation, surface normal estimation, reshading, keypoint detection, and edge detection. Our SS-NeRF framework can be a powerful tool for bridging generative learning and discriminative learning, and thus be beneficial to the investigation of a wide range of interesting problems, such as studying task relationships within a synthesis paradigm, transferring knowledge to novel tasks, facilitating downstream discriminative tasks as ways of data augmentation, and serving as auto-labeller for data creation.

### Open questions asked to analysis and numerics concerning the Hausdorff  moment problem
 - **Authors:** Daniel Gerth, Bernd Hofmann
 - **Subjects:** Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04127
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04127
 - **Abstract**
 We address facts and open questions concerning the degree of ill-posedness of the composite Hausdorff moment problem aimed at the recovery of a function $x \in L^2(0,1)$ from elements of the infinite dimensional sequence space $\ell^2$ that characterize moments applied to the antiderivative of $x$. This degree, unknown by now, results from the decay rate of the singular values of the associated compact forward operator $A$, which is the composition of the compact simple integration operator mapping in $L^2(0,1)$ and the non-compact Hausdorff moment operator $B^{(H)}$ mapping from $L^2(0,1)$ to $\ell^2$. There is a seeming contradiction between (a) numerical computations, which show (even for large $n$) an exponential decay of the singular values for $n$-dimensional matrices obtained by discretizing the operator $A$, and \linebreak (b) a strongly limited smoothness of the well-known kernel $k$ of the Hilbert-Schmidt operator $A^*A$. Fact (a) suggests severe ill-posedness of the infinite dimensional Hausdorff moment problem, whereas fact (b) lets us expect the opposite, because exponential ill-posedness occurs in common just for $C^\infty$-kernels $k$. We recall arguments for the possible occurrence of a polynomial decay of the singular values of $A$, even if the numerics seems to be against it, and discuss some issues in the numerical approximation of non-compact operators.

 - **Abstract**
 Semantic 3D scene understanding is a problem of critical importance in robotics. While significant advances have been made in simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms, robots are still far from having the common sense knowledge about household objects and their locations of an average human. We introduce a novel method for leveraging common sense embedded within large language models for labelling rooms given the objects contained within. This algorithm has the added benefits of (i) requiring no task-specific pre-training (operating entirely in the zero-shot regime) and (ii) generalizing to arbitrary room and object labels, including previously-unseen ones -- both of which are highly desirable traits in robotic scene understanding algorithms. The proposed algorithm operates on 3D scene graphs produced by modern spatial perception systems, and we hope it will pave the way to more generalizable and scalable high-level 3D scene understanding for robotics.

 - **Abstract**
 Guiding off-screen points of interest (POIs) is a practical way of providing additional information to users of small-screen devices, such as smart devices and head-mounted displays. Popular previous methods involve displaying a primitive figure referred to as Wedge on the screen for users to estimate off-screen POI on the invisible vertex. Because they utilize a cognitive process referred to as amodal completion, where users can imagine the entire figure even when a part of it is occluded, localization accuracy is influenced by bias and individual differences. To improve the accuracy, we propose to optimize the figure using a cognitive cost that considers the influence. We also design two types of optimizations with different parameters: unbiased OptWedge (UOW) and biased OptWedge (BOW). Experimental results indicate that OptWedge achieves more accurate guidance for a close distance compared to heuristics approach.

 - **Abstract**
 For a long time, anomaly localization has been widely used in industries. Previous studies focused on approximating the distribution of normal features without adaptation to a target dataset. However, since anomaly localization should precisely discriminate normal and abnormal features, the absence of adaptation may make the normality of abnormal features overestimated. Thus, we propose Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation (CFA) which accomplishes sophisticated anomaly localization using features adapted to the target dataset. CFA consists of (1) a learnable patch descriptor that learns and embeds target-oriented features and (2) scalable memory bank independent of the size of the target dataset. And, CFA adopts transfer learning to increase the normal feature density so that abnormal features can be clearly distinguished by applying patch descriptor and memory bank to a pre-trained CNN. The proposed method outperforms the previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively. For example, it provides an AUROC score of 99.5% in anomaly detection and 98.5% in anomaly localization of MVTec AD benchmark. In addition, this paper points out the negative effects of biased features of pre-trained CNNs and emphasizes the importance of the adaptation to the target dataset. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sungwool/CFA_for_anomaly_localization.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural networks are being increasingly used in critical systems, where ensuring their robustness and alignment is crucial. In this context, the field of explainable artificial intelligence has proposed the generation of high-level explanations through concept extraction. These methods detect whether a concept is present in an image, but are incapable of locating where. What is more, a fair comparison of approaches is difficult, as proper validation procedures are missing. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on representations obtained through the pixel-wise aggregations of activation maps of CNNs. Further, we introduce a process for the validation of concept-extraction techniques based on synthetic datasets with pixel-wise annotations of their main components, reducing human intervention. Through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our method achieves better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04115
 - **Abstract**
 Polylogrithmic functions, such as the logarithm or dilogarithm, satisfy a number of algebraic identities. For the logarithm, all the identities follow from the product rule. For the dilogarithm and higher-weight classical polylogarithms, the identities can involve five functions or more. In many calculations relevant to particle physics, complicated combinations of polylogarithms often arise from Feynman integrals. Although the initial expressions resulting from the integration usually simplify, it is often difficult to know which identities to apply and in what order. To address this bottleneck, we explore to what extent machine learning methods can help. We consider both a reinforcement learning approach, where the identities are analogous to moves in a game, and a transformer network approach, where the problem is viewed analogously to a language-translation task. While both methods are effective, the transformer network appears more powerful and holds promise for practical use in symbolic manipulation tasks in mathematical physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in Deep Learning and Computer Vision have alleviated many of the bottlenecks, allowing algorithms to be label-free with better performance. Specifically, Transformers provide a global perspective of the image, which Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) lack by design. Here we present \textbf{C}ross \textbf{A}rchitectural - \textbf{S}elf \textbf{S}upervision , a novel self-supervised learning approach which leverages transformers and CNN simultaneously, while also being computationally accessible to general practitioners via easily available cloud services. Compared to existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches, we empirically show CASS trained CNNs, and Transformers gained an average of 8.5\% with 100\% labelled data, 7.3\% with 10\% labelled data, and 11.5\% with 1\% labelled data, across three diverse datasets. Notably, one of the employed datasets included histopathology slides of an autoimmune disease, a topic underrepresented in Medical Imaging and has minimal data. In addition, our findings reveal that CASS is twice as efficient as other state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation equivariance is a desirable property in many practical applications such as motion forecasting and 3D perception, where it can offer benefits like sample efficiency, better generalization, and robustness to input perturbations. Vector Neurons (VN) is a recently developed framework offering a simple yet effective approach for deriving rotation-equivariant analogs of standard machine learning operations by extending one-dimensional scalar neurons to three-dimensional "vector neurons." We introduce a novel "VN-Transformer" architecture to address several shortcomings of the current VN models. Our contributions are: $(i)$ we derive a rotation-equivariant attention mechanism which eliminates the need for the heavy feature preprocessing required by the original Vector Neurons models; $(ii)$ we extend the VN framework to support non-spatial attributes, expanding the applicability of these models to real-world datasets; $(iii)$ we derive a rotation-equivariant mechanism for multi-scale reduction of point-cloud resolution, greatly speeding up inference and training; $(iv)$ we show that small tradeoffs in equivariance ($\epsilon$-approximate equivariance) can be used to obtain large improvements in numerical stability and training robustness on accelerated hardware, and we bound the propagation of equivariance violations in our models. Finally, we apply our VN-Transformer to 3D shape classification and motion forecasting with compelling results.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing work on generating hints in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) focuses mostly on manual and non-personalized feedback. In this work, we explore automatically generated questions as personalized feedback in an ITS. Our personalized feedback can pinpoint correct and incorrect or missing phrases in student answers as well as guide them towards correct answer by asking a question in natural language. Our approach combines cause-effect analysis to break down student answers using text similarity-based NLP Transformer models to identify correct and incorrect or missing parts. We train a few-shot Neural Question Generation and Question Re-ranking models to show questions addressing components missing in the student answers which steers students towards the correct answer. Our model vastly outperforms both simple and strong baselines in terms of student learning gains by 45% and 23% respectively when tested in a real dialogue-based ITS. Finally, we show that our personalized corrective feedback system has the potential to improve Generative Question Answering systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite advances in image classification methods, detecting the samples not belonging to the training classes is still a challenging problem. There has been a burst of interest in this subject recently, which is called Open-Set Recognition (OSR). In OSR, the goal is to achieve both the classification and detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Several ideas have been proposed to push the empirical result further through complicated techniques. We believe that such complication is indeed not necessary. To this end, we have shown that Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), as the simplest baseline for OSR, applied on Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the base classifier that is trained with non-OOD augmentations can surprisingly outperform many recent methods. Non-OOD augmentations are the ones that do not alter the data distribution by much. Our results outperform state-of-the-art in CIFAR-10 datasets, and is also better than most of the current methods in SVHN and MNIST. We show that training augmentation has a significant effect on the performance of ViTs in the OSR tasks, and while they should produce significant diversity in the augmented samples, the generated sample OOD-ness must remain limited.

 - **Abstract**
 According to the considerable growth in the avail of chest X-ray images in diagnosing various diseases, as well as gathering extensive datasets, having an automated diagnosis procedure using deep neural networks has occupied the minds of experts. Most of the available methods in computer vision use a CNN backbone to acquire high accuracy on the classification problems. Nevertheless, recent researches show that transformers, established as the de facto method in NLP, can also outperform many CNN-based models in vision. This paper proposes a multi-label classification deep model based on the Swin Transformer as the backbone to achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis classification. It leverages Multi-Layer Perceptron, also known as MLP, for the head architecture. We evaluate our model on one of the most widely-used and largest x-ray datasets called "Chest X-ray14," which comprises more than 100,000 frontal/back-view images from over 30,000 patients with 14 famous chest diseases. Our model has been tested with several number of MLP layers for the head setting, each achieves a competitive AUC score on all classes. Comprehensive experiments on Chest X-ray14 have shown that a 3-layer head attains state-of-the-art performance with an average AUC score of 0.810, compared to the former SOTA average AUC of 0.799. We propose an experimental setup for the fair benchmarking of existing methods, which could be used as a basis for the future studies. Finally, we followed up our results by confirming that the proposed method attends to the pathologically relevant areas of the chest.
### Unveiling Transformers with LEGO: a synthetic reasoning task

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04301
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04301
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a synthetic task, LEGO (Learning Equality and Group Operations), that encapsulates the problem of following a chain of reasoning, and we study how the transformer architecture learns this task. We pay special attention to data effects such as pretraining (on seemingly unrelated NLP tasks) and dataset composition (e.g., differing chain length at training and test time), as well as architectural variants such as weight-tied layers or adding convolutional components. We study how the trained models eventually succeed at the task, and in particular, we are able to understand (to some extent) some of the attention heads as well as how the information flows in the network. Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that here pretraining helps merely due to being a smart initialization rather than some deep knowledge stored in the network. We also observe that in some data regime the trained transformer finds "shortcut" solutions to follow the chain of reasoning, which impedes the model's ability to generalize to simple variants of the main task, and moreover we find that one can prevent such shortcut with appropriate architecture modification or careful data preparation. Motivated by our findings, we begin to explore the task of learning to execute C programs, where a convolutional modification to transformers, namely adding convolutional structures in the key/query/value maps, shows an encouraging edge.
### Topic-Aware Evaluation and Transformer Methods for Topic-Controllable  Summarization

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04317
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04317
 - **Abstract**
 Topic-controllable summarization is an emerging research area with a wide range of potential applications. However, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations. First, there is currently no established evaluation metric for this task. Furthermore, existing methods built upon recurrent architectures, which can significantly limit their performance compared to more recent Transformer-based architectures, while they also require modifications to the model's architecture for controlling the topic. In this work, we propose a new topic-oriented evaluation measure to automatically evaluate the generated summaries based on the topic affinity between the generated summary and the desired topic. We also conducted a user study that validates the reliability of this measure. Finally, we propose simple, yet powerful methods for topic-controllable summarization either incorporating topic embeddings into the model's architecture or employing control tokens to guide the summary generation. Experimental results show that control tokens can achieve better performance compared to more complicated embedding-based approaches while being at the same time significantly faster.
### VITA: Video Instance Segmentation via Object Token Association

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04403
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04403
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel paradigm for offline Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), based on the hypothesis that explicit object-oriented information can be a strong clue for understanding the context of the entire sequence. To this end, we propose VITA, a simple structure built on top of an off-the-shelf Transformer-based image instance segmentation model. Specifically, we use an image object detector as a means of distilling object-specific contexts into object tokens. VITA accomplishes video-level understanding by associating frame-level object tokens without using spatio-temporal backbone features. By effectively building relationships between objects using the condensed information, VITA achieves the state-of-the-art on VIS benchmarks with a ResNet-50 backbone: 49.8 AP, 45.7 AP on YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021 and 19.6 AP on OVIS. Moreover, thanks to its object token-based structure that is disjoint from the backbone features, VITA shows several practical advantages that previous offline VIS methods have not explored - handling long and high-resolution videos with a common GPU and freezing a frame-level detector trained on image domain. Code will be made available at https://github.com/sukjunhwang/VITA.

 - **Abstract**
 Although autoregressive models have achieved promising results on image generation, their unidirectional generation process prevents the resultant images from fully reflecting global contexts. To address the issue, we propose an effective image generation framework of Draft-and-Revise with Contextual RQ-transformer to consider global contexts during the generation process. As a generalized VQ-VAE, RQ-VAE first represents a high-resolution image as a sequence of discrete code stacks. After code stacks in the sequence are randomly masked, Contextual RQ-Transformer is trained to infill the masked code stacks based on the unmasked contexts of the image. Then, Contextual RQ-Transformer uses our two-phase decoding, Draft-and-Revise, and generates an image, while exploiting the global contexts of the image during the generation process. Specifically. in the draft phase, our model first focuses on generating diverse images despite rather low quality. Then, in the revise phase, the model iteratively improves the quality of images, while preserving the global contexts of generated images. In experiments, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on conditional image generation. We also validate that the Draft-and-Revise decoding can achieve high performance by effectively controlling the quality-diversity trade-off in image generation.
### cycle text2face: cycle text-to-face gan via transformers

 - **Abstract**
 Text-to-face is a subset of text-to-image that require more complex architecture due to their more detailed production. In this paper, we present an encoder-decoder model called Cycle Text2Face. Cycle Text2Face is a new initiative in the encoder part, it uses a sentence transformer and GAN to generate the image described by the text. The Cycle is completed by reproducing the text of the face in the decoder part of the model. Evaluating the model using the CelebA dataset, leads to better results than previous GAN-based models. In measuring the quality of the generate face, in addition to satisfying the human audience, we obtain an FID score of 3.458. This model, with high-speed processing, provides quality face images in the short time.

 - **Abstract**
 Human Pose Estimation (HPE) based on RGB images has experienced a rapid development benefiting from deep learning. However, event-based HPE has not been fully studied, which remains great potential for applications in extreme scenes and efficiency-critical conditions. In this paper, we are the first to estimate 2D human pose directly from 3D event point cloud. We propose a novel representation of events, the rasterized event point cloud, aggregating events on the same position of a small time slice. It maintains the 3D features from multiple statistical cues and significantly reduces memory consumption and computation complexity, proved to be efficient in our work. We then leverage the rasterized event point cloud as input to three different backbones, PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer, with two linear layer decoders to predict the location of human keypoints. We find that based on our method, PointNet achieves promising results with much faster speed, whereas Point Transfomer reaches much higher accuracy, even close to previous event-frame-based methods. A comprehensive set of results demonstrates that our proposed method is consistently effective for these 3D backbone models in event-driven human pose estimation. Our method based on PointNet with 2048 points input achieves 82.46mm in MPJPE3D on the DHP19 dataset, while only has a latency of 12.29ms on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX edge computing platform, which is ideally suitable for real-time detection with event cameras.

 - **Abstract**
 Most pipelines for Augmented and Virtual Reality estimate the ego-motion of the camera by creating a map of sparse 3D landmarks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of depth completion, that is, densifying this sparse 3D map using RGB images as guidance. This remains a challenging problem due to the low density, non-uniform and outlier-prone 3D landmarks produced by SfM and SLAM pipelines. We introduce a transformer block, SparseFormer, that fuses 3D landmarks with deep visual features to produce dense depth. The SparseFormer has a global receptive field, making the module especially effective for depth completion with low-density and non-uniform landmarks. To address the issue of depth outliers among the 3D landmarks, we introduce a trainable refinement module that filters outliers through attention between the sparse landmarks.

 - **Abstract**
 End-to-end (E2E) speech-to-text translation (ST) often depends on pretraining its encoder and/or decoder using source transcripts via speech recognition or text translation tasks, without which translation performance drops substantially. However, transcripts are not always available, and how significant such pretraining is for E2E ST has rarely been studied in the literature. In this paper, we revisit this question and explore the extent to which the quality of E2E ST trained on speech-translation pairs alone can be improved. We reexamine several techniques proven beneficial to ST previously, and offer a set of best practices that biases a Transformer-based E2E ST system toward training from scratch. Besides, we propose parameterized distance penalty to facilitate the modeling of locality in the self-attention model for speech. On four benchmarks covering 23 languages, our experiments show that, without using any transcripts or pretraining, the proposed system reaches and even outperforms previous studies adopting pretraining, although the gap remains in (extremely) low-resource settings. Finally, we discuss neural acoustic feature modeling, where a neural model is designed to extract acoustic features from raw speech signals directly, with the goal to simplify inductive biases and add freedom to the model in describing speech. For the first time, we demonstrate its feasibility and show encouraging results on ST tasks.

 Extracting Handwritten text is one of the most important components of digitizing information and making it available for large scale setting. Handwriting Optical Character Reader (OCR) is a research problem in computer vision and natural language processing computing, and a lot of work has been done for English, but unfortunately, very little work has been done for low resourced languages such as Urdu. Urdu language script is very difficult because of its cursive nature and change of shape of characters based on it's relative position, therefore, a need arises to propose a model which can understand complex features and generalize it for every kind of handwriting style. In this work, we propose a transformer based Urdu Handwritten text extraction model. As transformers have been very successful in Natural Language Understanding task, we explore them further to understand complex Urdu Handwriting.

 - **Abstract**
 Learning Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation from surrounding-view cameras is of great importance for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a Geometry-guided Kernel Transformer (GKT), a novel 2D-to-BEV representation learning mechanism. GKT leverages the geometric priors to guide the transformer to focus on discriminative regions and unfolds kernel features to generate BEV representation. For fast inference, we further introduce a look-up table (LUT) indexing method to get rid of the camera's calibrated parameters at runtime. GKT can run at $72.3$ FPS on 3090 GPU / $45.6$ FPS on 2080ti GPU and is robust to the camera deviation and the predefined BEV height. And GKT achieves the state-of-the-art real-time segmentation results, i.e., 38.0 mIoU (100m$\times$100m perception range at a 0.5m resolution) on the nuScenes val set. Given the efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness, GKT has great practical values in autopilot scenarios, especially for real-time running systems. Code and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/GKT}.

 - **Abstract**
 Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has shown that the attention maps of Vision Transformers (VTs), when trained with self-supervision, can contain a semantic segmentation structure which does not spontaneously emerge when training is supervised. In this paper, we explicitly encourage the emergence of this spatial clustering as a form of training regularization, this way including a self-supervised pretext task into the standard supervised learning. In more detail, we propose a VT regularization method based on a spatial formulation of the information entropy. By minimizing the proposed spatial entropy, we explicitly ask the VT to produce spatially ordered attention maps, this way including an object-based prior during training. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed regularization approach is beneficial with different training scenarios, datasets, downstream tasks and VT architectures. The code will be available upon acceptance.

 - **Abstract**
 Online action detection is the task of predicting the action as soon as it happens in a streaming video. A major challenge is that the model does not have access to the future and has to solely rely on the history, i.e., the frames observed so far, to make predictions. It is therefore important to accentuate parts of the history that are more informative to the prediction of the current frame. We present GateHUB, Gated History Unit with Background Suppression, that comprises a novel position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to enhance or suppress parts of the history as per how informative they are for current frame prediction. GateHUB further proposes Future-augmented History (FaH) to make history features more informative by using subsequently observed frames when available. In a single unified framework, GateHUB integrates the transformer's ability of long-range temporal modeling and the recurrent model's capacity to selectively encode relevant information. GateHUB also introduces a background suppression objective to further mitigate false positive background frames that closely resemble the action frames. Extensive validation on three benchmark datasets, THUMOS, TVSeries, and HDD, demonstrates that GateHUB significantly outperforms all existing methods and is also more efficient than the existing best work. Furthermore, a flow-free version of GateHUB is able to achieve higher or close accuracy at 2.8x higher frame rate compared to all existing methods that require both RGB and optical flow information for prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 PointNet++ is one of the most influential neural architectures for point cloud understanding. Although the accuracy of PointNet++ has been largely surpassed by recent networks such as PointMLP and Point Transformer, we find that a large portion of the performance gain is due to improved training strategies, i.e. data augmentation and optimization techniques, and increased model sizes rather than architectural innovations. Thus, the full potential of PointNet++ has yet to be explored. In this work, we revisit the classical PointNet++ through a systematic study of model training and scaling strategies, and offer two major contributions. First, we propose a set of improved training strategies that significantly improve PointNet++ performance. For example, we show that, without any change in architecture, the overall accuracy (OA) of PointNet++ on ScanObjectNN object classification can be raised from 77.9\% to 86.1\%, even outperforming state-of-the-art PointMLP. Second, we introduce an inverted residual bottleneck design and separable MLPs into PointNet++ to enable efficient and effective model scaling and propose PointNeXt, the next version of PointNets. PointNeXt can be flexibly scaled up and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both 3D classification and segmentation tasks. For classification, PointNeXt reaches an overall accuracy of $87.7\%$ on ScanObjectNN, surpassing PointMLP by $2.3\%$, while being $10 \times$ faster in inference. For semantic segmentation, PointNeXt establishes a new state-of-the-art performance with $74.9\%$ mean IoU on S3DIS (6-fold cross-validation), being superior to the recent Point Transformer.

 - **Abstract**
 The size of vision models has grown exponentially over the last few years, especially after the emergence of Vision Transformer. This has motivated the development of parameter-efficient tuning methods, such as learning adapter layers or visual prompt tokens, which allow a tiny portion of model parameters to be trained whereas the vast majority obtained from pre-training are frozen. However, designing a proper tuning method is non-trivial: one might need to try out a lengthy list of design choices, not to mention that each downstream dataset often requires custom designs. In this paper, we view the existing parameter-efficient tuning methods as "prompt modules" and propose Neural prOmpt seArcH (NOAH), a novel approach that learns, for large vision models, the optimal design of prompt modules through a neural architecture search algorithm, specifically for each downstream dataset. By conducting extensive experiments on over 20 vision datasets, we demonstrate that NOAH (i) is superior to individual prompt modules, (ii) has a good few-shot learning ability, and (iii) is domain-generalizable. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Davidzhangyuanhan/NOAH.

 - **Abstract**
 Adversarial examples represent a serious threat for deep neural networks in several application domains and a huge amount of work has been produced to investigate them and mitigate their effects. Nevertheless, no much work has been devoted to the generation of datasets specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of neural models. This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-the-art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test. Finally, the paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the performance of some defense methods against such attacks, showing how the datasets generated with CARLA-GeAR might be used in future work as a benchmark for adversarial defense in the real world.
