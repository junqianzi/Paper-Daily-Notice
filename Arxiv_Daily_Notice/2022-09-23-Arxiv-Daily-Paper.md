 - **Abstract**
 The real-world deployment of fully autonomous mobile robots depends on a robust SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system, capable of handling dynamic environments, where objects are moving in front of the robot, and changing environments, where objects are moved or replaced after the robot has already mapped the scene. This paper presents Changing-SLAM, a method for robust Visual SLAM in both dynamic and changing environments. This is achieved by using a Bayesian filter combined with a long-term data association algorithm. Also, it employs an efficient algorithm for dynamic keypoints filtering based on object detection that correctly identify features inside the bounding box that are not dynamic, preventing a depletion of features that could cause lost tracks. Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D data especially designed for the evaluation of changing environments on an object level, called PUC-USP dataset. Six sequences were created using a mobile robot, an RGB-D camera and a motion capture system. The sequences were designed to capture different scenarios that could lead to a tracking failure or a map corruption. To the best of our knowledge, Changing-SLAM is the first Visual SLAM system that is robust to both dynamic and changing environments, not assuming a given camera pose or a known map, being also able to operate in real time. The proposed method was evaluated using benchmark datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods, proving to be highly accurate.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a new method that fuses acoustic measurements in the reverberation field and low-accuracy inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion reports for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Different from existing studies that only use acoustic data for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimates, the source's distance from sensors is calculated with the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and applied as a new constraint to eliminate the nonlinear noise from motion reports. A particle filter is applied to estimate the critical distance, which is key for associating the source's distance with the DRR. A keyframe method is used to eliminate the deviation of the source position estimation toward the robot. The proposed DoA-DRR acoustic SLAM (D-D SLAM) is designed for three-dimensional motion and is suitable for most robots. The method is the first acoustic SLAM algorithm that has been validated on a real-world indoor scene dataset that contains only acoustic data and IMU measurements. Compared with previous methods, D-D SLAM has acceptable performance in locating the robot and building a source map from a real-world indoor dataset. The average location accuracy is 0.48 m, while the source position error converges to less than 0.25 m within 2.8 s. These results prove the effectiveness of D-D SLAM in real-world indoor scenes, which may be especially useful in search and rescue missions after disasters where the environment is foggy, i.e., unsuitable for light or laser irradiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Object SLAM uses additional semantic information to detect and map objects in the scene, in order to improve the system's perception and map representation capabilities. Quadrics and cubes are often used to represent objects, but their single shape limits the accuracy of object map and thus affects the application of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters into SLAM for representing objects, and propose a separate parameter estimation method that can accurately estimate object pose and adapt to different shapes. Furthermore, we present a lightweight data association strategy for correctly associating semantic observations in multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object map and has advantages in object representation. Code will be released upon acceptance.

 - **Abstract**
 Robotic perception is currently at a cross-roads between modern methods which operate in an efficient latent space, and classical methods which are mathematically founded and provide interpretable, trustworthy results. In this paper, we introduce a Convolutional Bayesian Kernel Inference (ConvBKI) layer which explicitly performs Bayesian inference within a depthwise separable convolution layer to simultaneously maximize efficiency while maintaining reliability. We apply our layer to the task of 3D semantic mapping, where we learn semantic-geometric probability distributions for LiDAR sensor information in real time. We evaluate our network against state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms on the KITTI data set, and demonstrate improved latency with comparable semantic results.

 - **Abstract**
 3D object detection with multi-sensors is essential for an accurate and reliable perception system of autonomous driving and robotics. Existing 3D detectors significantly improve the accuracy by adopting a two-stage paradigm which merely relies on LiDAR point clouds for 3D proposal refinement. Though impressive, the sparsity of point clouds, especially for the points far away, making it difficult for the LiDAR-only refinement module to accurately recognize and locate objects.To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-modality two-stage approach named FusionRCNN, which effectively and efficiently fuses point clouds and camera images in the Regions of Interest(RoI). FusionRCNN adaptively integrates both sparse geometry information from LiDAR and dense texture information from camera in a unified attention mechanism. Specifically, it first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an image set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points within proposals in the RoI extraction step; then leverages an intra-modality self-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, following by a well-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two modalities.FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different one-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performances of popular detectors.Remarkably, FusionRCNN significantly improves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14% mAP on Waymo, and outperforms competing two-stage approaches. Code will be released soon at https://github.com/xxlbigbrother/Fusion-RCNN.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-agent exploration of a bounded 3D environment with unknown initial positions of agents is a challenging problem. It requires quickly exploring the environments as well as robustly merging the sub-maps built by the agents. We take the view that the existing approaches are either aggressive or conservative: Aggressive strategies merge two sub-maps built by different agents together when overlap is detected, which can lead to incorrect merging due to the false-positive detection of the overlap and is thus not robust. Conservative strategies direct one agent to revisit an excessive amount of the historical trajectory of another agent for verification before merging, which can lower the exploration efficiency due to the repeated exploration of the same space. To intelligently balance the robustness of sub-map merging and exploration efficiency, we develop a new approach for lidar-based multi-agent exploration, which can direct one agent to repeat another agent's trajectory in an \emph{adaptive} manner based on the quality indicator of the sub-map merging process. Additionally, our approach extends the recent single-agent hierarchical exploration strategy to multiple agents in a \emph{cooperative} manner by planning for agents with merged sub-maps together to further improve exploration efficiency. Our experiments show that our approach is up to 50\% more efficient than the baselines on average while merging sub-maps robustly.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating realistic sensors is a challenging part in data generation for autonomous systems, often involving carefully handcrafted sensor design, scene properties, and physics modeling. To alleviate this, we introduce a pipeline for data-driven simulation of a realistic LiDAR sensor. We propose a model that learns a mapping between RGB images and corresponding LiDAR features such as raydrop or per-point intensities directly from real datasets. We show that our model can learn to encode realistic effects such as dropped points on transparent surfaces or high intensity returns on reflective materials. When applied to naively raycasted point clouds provided by off-the-shelf simulator software, our model enhances the data by predicting intensities and removing points based on the scene's appearance to match a real LiDAR sensor. We use our technique to learn models of two distinct LiDAR sensors and use them to improve simulated LiDAR data accordingly. Through a sample task of vehicle segmentation, we show that enhancing simulated point clouds with our technique improves downstream task performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We suggest the first system that runs real-time semantic segmentation via deep learning on a weak micro-computer such as the Raspberry Pi Zero v2 (whose price was \$15) attached to a toy-drone. In particular, since the Raspberry Pi weighs less than $16$ grams, and its size is half of a credit card, we could easily attach it to the common commercial DJI Tello toy-drone (<\$100, <90 grams, 98 $\times$ 92.5 $\times$ 41 mm). The result is an autonomous drone (no laptop nor human in the loop) that can detect and classify objects in real-time from a video stream of an on-board monocular RGB camera (no GPS or LIDAR sensors). The companion videos demonstrate how this Tello drone scans the lab for people (e.g. for the use of firefighters or security forces) and for an empty parking slot outside the lab. Existing deep learning solutions are either much too slow for real-time computation on such IoT devices, or provide results of impractical quality. Our main challenge was to design a system that takes the best of all worlds among numerous combinations of networks, deep learning platforms/frameworks, compression techniques, and compression ratios. To this end, we provide an efficient searching algorithm that aims to find the optimal combination which results in the best tradeoff between the network running time and its accuracy/performance.

 - **Abstract**
 Robotics has long been a field riddled with complex systems architectures whose modules and connections, whether traditional or learning-based, require significant human expertise and prior knowledge. Inspired by large pre-trained language models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general purpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on a given robot. We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a generative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations directly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive prediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes dynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific representation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct tasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form factors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR), and a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that finetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model results in significantly better performance compared to training a single model from scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to training a separate large model for each task independently. By sharing a common good-quality representation across tasks we can lower overall model capacity and speed up the real-time deployment of such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural fields model signals by mapping coordinate inputs to sampled values. They are becoming an increasingly important backbone architecture across many fields from vision and graphics to biology and astronomy. In this paper, we explore the differences between common conditioning mechanisms within these networks, an essential ingredient in shifting neural fields from memorization of signals to generalization, where the set of signals lying on a manifold is modelled jointly. In particular, we are interested in the scaling behaviour of these mechanisms to increasingly high-dimensional conditioning variables. As we show in our experiments, high-dimensional conditioning is key to modelling complex data distributions, thus it is important to determine what architecture choices best enable this when working on such problems. To this end, we run experiments modelling 2D, 3D, and 4D signals with neural fields, employing concatenation, hyper-network, and attention-based conditioning strategies -- a necessary but laborious effort that has not been performed in the literature. We find that attention-based conditioning outperforms other approaches in a variety of settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiking neural networks (SNNs) mimic brain computational strategies, and exhibit substantial capabilities in spatiotemporal information processing. As an essential factor for human perception, visual attention refers to the dynamic selection process of salient regions in biological vision systems. Although mechanisms of visual attention have achieved great success in computer vision, they are rarely introduced into SNNs. Inspired by experimental observations on predictive attentional remapping, we here propose a new spatial-channel-temporal-fused attention (SCTFA) module that can guide SNNs to efficiently capture underlying target regions by utilizing historically accumulated spatial-channel information. Through a systematic evaluation on three event stream datasets (DVS Gesture, SL-Animals-DVS and MNIST-DVS), we demonstrate that the SNN with the SCTFA module (SCTFA-SNN) not only significantly outperforms the baseline SNN (BL-SNN) and other two SNN models with degenerated attention modules, but also achieves competitive accuracy with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our detailed analysis shows that the proposed SCTFA-SNN model has strong robustness to noise and outstanding stability to incomplete data, while maintaining acceptable complexity and efficiency. Overall, these findings indicate that appropriately incorporating cognitive mechanisms of the brain may provide a promising approach to elevate the capability of SNNs.

 - **Abstract**
 When operating massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels at different frequencies (frequency division duplex (FDD) operation), acquisition of channel state information (CSI) for downlink precoding is a major challenge. Since, barring transceiver impairments, both UL and DL CSI are determined by the physical environment surrounding transmitter and receiver, it stands to reason that, for a static environment, a mapping from UL CSI to DL CSI may exist. First, we propose to use various neural network (NN)-based approaches that learn this mapping and provide baselines using classical signal processing. Second, we introduce a scheme to evaluate the performance and quality of generalization of all approaches, distinguishing between known and previously unseen physical locations. Third, we evaluate all approaches on a real-world indoor dataset collected with a 32-antenna channel sounder.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11028
 - **Abstract**
 When considering motion planning for a swarm of $n$ labeled robots, we need to rearrange a given start configuration into a desired target configuration via a sequence of parallel, continuous, collision-free robot motions. The objective is to reach the new configuration in a minimum amount of time; an important constraint is to keep the swarm connected at all times. Problems of this type have been considered before, with recent notable results achieving constant stretch for not necessarily connected reconfiguration: If mapping the start configuration to the target configuration requires a maximum Manhattan distance of $d$, the total duration of an overall schedule can be bounded to $\mathcal{O}(d)$, which is optimal up to constant factors. However, constant stretch could only be achieved if disconnected reconfiguration is allowed, or for scaled configurations (which arise by increasing all dimensions of a given object by the same multiplicative factor) of unlabeled robots. We resolve these major open problems by (1) establishing a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for connected, labeled reconfiguration and, most importantly, by (2) proving that for scaled arrangements, constant stretch for connected reconfiguration can be achieved. In addition, we show that (3) it is NP-hard to decide whether a makespan of 2 can be achieved, while it is possible to check in polynomial time whether a makespan of 1 can be achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 Inverted landing in a rapid and robust manner is a challenging feat for aerial robots, especially while depending entirely on onboard sensing and computation. In spite of this, this feat is routinely performed by biological fliers such as bats, flies, and bees. Our previous work has identified a direct causal connection between a series of onboard visual cues and kinematic actions that allow for reliable execution of this challenging aerobatic maneuver in small aerial robots. In this work, we first utilized Deep Reinforcement Learning and a physics-based simulation to obtain a general, optimal control policy for robust inverted landing starting from any arbitrary approach condition. This optimized control policy provides a computationally-efficient mapping from the system's observational space to its motor command action space, including both triggering and control of rotational maneuvers. This was done by training the system over a large range of approach flight velocities that varied with magnitude and direction. Next, we performed a sim-to-real transfer and experimental validation of the learned policy via domain randomization, by varying the robot's inertial parameters in the simulation. Through experimental trials, we identified several dominant factors which greatly improved landing robustness and the primary mechanisms that determined inverted landing success. We expect the learning framework developed in this study can be generalized to solve more challenging tasks, such as utilizing noisy onboard sensory data, landing on surfaces of various orientations, or landing on dynamically-moving surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 Off-road autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are being developed for military and commercial use to deliver crucial supplies in remote locations, help with mapping and surveillance, and to assist war-fighters in contested environments. Due to complexity of the off-road environments and variability in terrain, lighting conditions, diurnal and seasonal changes, the models used to perceive the environment must handle a lot of input variability. Current datasets used to train perception models for off-road autonomous navigation lack of diversity in seasons, locations, semantic classes, as well as time of day. We test the hypothesis that model trained on a single dataset may not generalize to other off-road navigation datasets and new locations due to the input distribution drift. Additionally, we investigate how to combine multiple datasets to train a semantic segmentation-based environment perception model and we show that training the model to capture uncertainty could improve the model performance by a significant margin. We extend the Masksembles approach for uncertainty quantification to the semantic segmentation task and compare it with Monte Carlo Dropout and standard baselines. Finally, we test the approach against data collected from a UGV platform in a new testing environment. We show that the developed perception model with uncertainty quantification can be feasibly deployed on an UGV to support online perception and navigation tasks.

Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D data especially designed for the evaluation of changing environments on an object level, called PUC-USP dataset. Six sequences were created using a mobile robot, an RGB-D camera and a motion capture system. The sequences were designed to capture different scenarios that could lead to a tracking failure or a map corruption. To the best of our knowledge, Changing-SLAM is the first Visual SLAM system that is robust to both dynamic and changing environments, not assuming a given camera pose or a known map, being also able to operate in real time. The proposed method was evaluated using benchmark datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods, proving to be highly accurate.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a new method that fuses acoustic measurements in the reverberation field and low-accuracy inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion reports for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Different from existing studies that only use acoustic data for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimates, the source's distance from sensors is calculated with the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and applied as a new constraint to eliminate the nonlinear noise from motion reports. A particle filter is applied to estimate the critical distance, which is key for associating the source's distance with the DRR. A keyframe method is used to eliminate the deviation of the source position estimation toward the robot. The proposed DoA-DRR acoustic SLAM (D-D SLAM) is designed for three-dimensional motion and is suitable for most robots. The method is the first acoustic SLAM algorithm that has been validated on a real-world indoor scene dataset that contains only acoustic data and IMU measurements. Compared with previous methods, D-D SLAM has acceptable performance in locating the robot and building a source map from a real-world indoor dataset. The average location accuracy is 0.48 m, while the source position error converges to less than 0.25 m within 2.8 s. These results prove the effectiveness of D-D SLAM in real-world indoor scenes, which may be especially useful in search and rescue missions after disasters where the environment is foggy, i.e., unsuitable for light or laser irradiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering the functionality of situational awareness in safety-critical automation systems, the perception of risk in driving scenes and its explainability is of particular importance for autonomous and cooperative driving. Toward this goal, this paper proposes a new research direction of joint risk localization in driving scenes and its risk explanation as a natural language description. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks, we collected a large-scale dataset, DRAMA (Driving Risk Assessment Mechanism with A captioning module), which consists of 17,785 interactive driving scenarios collected in Tokyo, Japan. Our DRAMA dataset accommodates video- and object-level questions on driving risks with associated important objects to achieve the goal of visual captioning as a free-form language description utilizing closed and open-ended responses for multi-level questions, which can be used to evaluate a range of visual captioning capabilities in driving scenarios. We make this data available to the community for further research. Using DRAMA, we explore multiple facets of joint risk localization and captioning in interactive driving scenarios. In particular, we benchmark various multi-task prediction architectures and provide a detailed analysis of joint risk localization and risk captioning.

 - **Abstract**
 High reliability guarantees for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) require accurate knowledge of channel statistics, used as an input for rate selection. Exploiting the spatial consistency of channel statistics arises as a promising solution, allowing a base station to predict the propagation conditions and select the communication parameters for a new user from samples collected from previous users of the network. Based on this idea, this article provides a timely framework to exploit long-range channel spatial correlation through so-called statistical radio maps, enabling URLLC communications with given statistical guarantees. The framework is exemplified by predicting the channel capacity distribution both in a location-based radio map and in a latent space rendered by a channel chart, the latter being a localization-free approach based on channel state information (CSI). It is also shown how to use the maps to select the transmission rate in a new location that achieves a target level of reliability. Finally, several future directions and research challenges are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Robotics has long been a field riddled with complex systems architectures whose modules and connections, whether traditional or learning-based, require significant human expertise and prior knowledge. Inspired by large pre-trained language models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general purpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on a given robot. We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a generative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations directly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive prediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes dynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific representation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct tasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form factors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR), and a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that finetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model results in significantly better performance compared to training a single model from scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to training a separate large model for each task independently. By sharing a common good-quality representation across tasks we can lower overall model capacity and speed up the real-time deployment of such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.

 Despite decades of research, existing navigation systems still face real-world challenges when deployed in the wild, e.g., in cluttered home environments or in human-occupied public spaces. To address this, we present a new class of implicit control policies combining the benefits of imitation learning with the robust handling of system constraints from Model Predictive Control (MPC). Our approach, called Performer-MPC, uses a learned cost function parameterized by vision context embeddings provided by Performers -- a low-rank implicit-attention Transformer. We jointly train the cost function and construct the controller relying on it, effectively solving end-to-end the corresponding bi-level optimization problem. We show that the resulting policy improves standard MPC performance by leveraging a few expert demonstrations of the desired navigation behavior in different challenging real-world scenarios. Compared with a standard MPC policy, Performer-MPC achieves >40% better goal reached in cluttered environments and >65% better on social metrics when navigating around humans.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformer is a deep learning language model widely used for natural language processing (NLP) services in datacenters. Among transformer models, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has achieved remarkable performance in text generation, or natural language generation (NLG), which needs the processing of a large input context in the summarization stage, followed by the generation stage that produces a single word at a time. The conventional platforms such as GPU are specialized for the parallel processing of large inputs in the summarization stage, but their performance significantly degrades in the generation stage due to its sequential characteristic. Therefore, an efficient hardware platform is required to address the high latency caused by the sequential characteristic of text generation. In this paper, we present DFX, a multi-FPGA acceleration appliance that executes GPT-2 model inference end-to-end with low latency and high throughput in both summarization and generation stages. DFX uses model parallelism and optimized dataflow that is model-and-hardware-aware for fast simultaneous workload execution among devices. Its compute cores operate on custom instructions and provide GPT-2 operations end-to-end. We implement the proposed hardware architecture on four Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs and utilize all of the channels of the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the maximum number of compute resources for high hardware efficiency. DFX achieves 5.58x speedup and 3.99x energy efficiency over four NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the modern GPT-2 model. DFX is also 8.21x more cost-effective than the GPU appliance, suggesting that it is a promising solution for text generation workloads in cloud datacenters.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers are widely used in NLP, where they consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. This is due to their attention-based architecture, which allows them to model rich linguistic relations between words. However, transformers are difficult to interpret. Being able to provide reasoning for its decisions is an important property for a model in domains where human lives are affected, such as hate speech detection and biomedicine. With transformers finding wide use in these fields, the need for interpretability techniques tailored to them arises. The effectiveness of attention-based interpretability techniques for transformers in text classification is studied in this work. Despite concerns about attention-based interpretations in the literature, we show that, with proper setup, attention may be used in such tasks with results comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, while also being faster and friendlier to the environment. We validate our claims with a series of experiments that employ a new feature importance metric.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vision Transformer architecture has shown to be competitive in the computer vision (CV) space where it has dethroned convolution-based networks in several benchmarks. Nevertheless, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) remain the preferential architecture for the representation module in Reinforcement Learning. In this work, we study pretraining a Vision Transformer using several state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and assess data-efficiency gains from this training framework. We propose a new self-supervised learning method called TOV-VICReg that extends VICReg to better capture temporal relations between observations by adding a temporal order verification task. Furthermore, we evaluate the resultant encoders with Atari games in a sample-efficiency regime. Our results show that the vision transformer, when pretrained with TOV-VICReg, outperforms the other self-supervised methods but still struggles to overcome a CNN. Nevertheless, we were able to outperform a CNN in two of the ten games where we perform a 100k steps evaluation. Ultimately, we believe that such approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) might be the key to achieving new levels of performance as seen in natural language processing and computer vision.

 - **Abstract**
 People's looking at each other or mutual gaze is ubiquitous in our daily interactions, and detecting mutual gaze is of great significance for understanding human social scenes. Current mutual gaze detection methods focus on two-stage methods, whose inference speed is limited by the two-stage pipeline and the performance in the second stage is affected by the first one. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage mutual gaze detection framework called Mutual Gaze TRansformer or MGTR to perform mutual gaze detection in an end-to-end manner. By designing mutual gaze instance triples, MGTR can detect each human head bounding box and simultaneously infer mutual gaze relationship based on global image information, which streamlines the whole process with simplicity. Experimental results on two mutual gaze datasets show that our method is able to accelerate mutual gaze detection process without losing performance. Ablation study shows that different components of MGTR can capture different levels of semantic information in images. Code is available at https://github.com/Gmbition/MGTR

 - **Abstract**
 Covid-19 has spread across the world and several vaccines have been developed to counter its surge. To identify the correct sentiments associated with the vaccines from social media posts, we fine-tune various state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models on tweets associated with Covid-19 vaccines. Specifically, we use the recently introduced state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models RoBERTa, XLNet and BERT, and the domain-specific transformer models CT-BERT and BERTweet that are pre-trained on Covid-19 tweets. We further explore the option of text augmentation by oversampling using Language Model based Oversampling Technique (LMOTE) to improve the accuracies of these models, specifically, for small sample datasets where there is an imbalanced class distribution among the positive, negative and neutral sentiment classes. Our results summarize our findings on the suitability of text oversampling for imbalanced small sample datasets that are used to fine-tune state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models, and the utility of domain-specific transformer models for the classification task.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent few-shot methods, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and pattern exploiting training (PET), have achieved impressive results in label-scarce settings. However, they are difficult to employ since they are subject to high variability from manually crafted prompts, and typically require billion-parameter language models to achieve high accuracy. To address these shortcomings, we propose SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning), an efficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence Transformers (ST). SetFit works by first fine-tuning a pretrained ST on a small number of text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner. The resulting model is then used to generate rich text embeddings, which are used to train a classification head. This simple framework requires no prompts or verbalizers, and achieves high accuracy with orders of magnitude less parameters than existing techniques. Our experiments show that SetFit obtains comparable results with PEFT and PET techniques, while being an order of magnitude faster to train. We also show that SetFit can be applied in multilingual settings by simply switching the ST body. Our code is available at https://github.com/huggingface/setfit and our datasets at https://huggingface.co/setfit .

 - **Abstract**
 Convolution-augmented transformers (Conformers) are recently proposed in various speech-domain applications, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech separation, as they can capture both local and global dependencies. In this paper, we propose a conformer-based metric generative adversarial network (CMGAN) for speech enhancement (SE) in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The generator encodes the magnitude and complex spectrogram information using two-stage conformer blocks to model both time and frequency dependencies. The decoder then decouples the estimation into a magnitude mask decoder branch to filter out unwanted distortions and a complex refinement branch to further improve the magnitude estimation and implicitly enhance the phase information. Additionally, we include a metric discriminator to alleviate metric mismatch by optimizing the generator with respect to a corresponding evaluation score. Objective and subjective evaluations illustrate that CMGAN is able to show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in three speech enhancement tasks (denoising, dereverberation and super-resolution). For instance, quantitative denoising analysis on Voice Bank+DEMAND dataset indicates that CMGAN outperforms various previous models with a margin, i.e., PESQ of 3.41 and SSNR of 11.10 dB.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the problem of traffic accident risk forecasting has been getting the attention of the intelligent transportation systems community due to its significant impact on traffic clearance. This problem is commonly tackled in the literature by using data-driven approaches that model the spatial and temporal incident impact, since they were shown to be crucial for the traffic accident risk forecasting problem. To achieve this, most approaches build different architectures to capture the spatio-temporal correlations features, making them inefficient for large traffic accident datasets. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a novel unified framework, namely a contextual vision transformer, that can be trained in an end-to-end approach which can effectively reason about the spatial and temporal aspects of the problem while providing accurate traffic accident risk predictions. We evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed methodology against baseline approaches from the literature across two large-scale traffic accident datasets from two different geographical locations. The results have shown a significant improvement with roughly 2\% in RMSE score in comparison to previous state-of-art works (SoTA) in the literature. Moreover, our proposed approach has outperformed the SoTA technique over the two datasets while only requiring 23x fewer computational requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose the first unified framework UniColor to support colorization in multiple modalities, including both unconditional and conditional ones, such as stroke, exemplar, text, and even a mix of them. Rather than learning a separate model for each type of condition, we introduce a two-stage colorization framework for incorporating various conditions into a single model. In the first stage, multi-modal conditions are converted into a common representation of hint points. Particularly, we propose a novel CLIP-based method to convert the text to hint points. In the second stage, we propose a Transformer-based network composed of Chroma-VQGAN and Hybrid-Transformer to generate diverse and high-quality colorization results conditioned on hint points. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in every control modality and further enables multi-modal colorization that was not feasible before. Moreover, we design an interactive interface showing the effectiveness of our unified framework in practical usage, including automatic colorization, hybrid-control colorization, local recolorization, and iterative color editing. Our code and models are available at https://luckyhzt.github.io/unicolor.

 - **Abstract**
 Uncertainty plays a key role in future prediction. The future is uncertain. That means there might be many possible futures. A future prediction method should cover the whole possibilities to be robust. In autonomous driving, covering multiple modes in the prediction part is crucially important to make safety-critical decisions. Although computer vision systems have advanced tremendously in recent years, future prediction remains difficult today. Several examples are uncertainty of the future, the requirement of full scene understanding, and the noisy outputs space. In this thesis, we propose solutions to these challenges by modeling the motion explicitly in a stochastic way and learning the temporal dynamics in a latent space.

 - **Abstract**
 3D object detection with multi-sensors is essential for an accurate and reliable perception system of autonomous driving and robotics. Existing 3D detectors significantly improve the accuracy by adopting a two-stage paradigm which merely relies on LiDAR point clouds for 3D proposal refinement. Though impressive, the sparsity of point clouds, especially for the points far away, making it difficult for the LiDAR-only refinement module to accurately recognize and locate objects.To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-modality two-stage approach named FusionRCNN, which effectively and efficiently fuses point clouds and camera images in the Regions of Interest(RoI). FusionRCNN adaptively integrates both sparse geometry information from LiDAR and dense texture information from camera in a unified attention mechanism. Specifically, it first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an image set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points within proposals in the RoI extraction step; then leverages an intra-modality self-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, following by a well-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two modalities.FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different one-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performances of popular detectors.Remarkably, FusionRCNN significantly improves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14% mAP on Waymo, and outperforms competing two-stage approaches. Code will be released soon at https://github.com/xxlbigbrother/Fusion-RCNN.

 - **Abstract**
 Although robotics courses are well established in higher education, the courses often focus on theory and sometimes lack the systematic coverage of the techniques involved in developing, deploying, and applying software to real hardware. Additionally, most hardware platforms for robotics teaching are low-level toys aimed at younger students at middle-school levels. To address this gap, an autonomous vehicle hardware platform, called F1TENTH, is developed for teaching autonomous systems hands-on. This article describes the teaching modules and software stack for teaching at various educational levels with the theme of "racing" and competitions that replace exams. The F1TENTH vehicles offer a modular hardware platform and its related software for teaching the fundamentals of autonomous driving algorithms. From basic reactive methods to advanced planning algorithms, the teaching modules enhance students' computational thinking through autonomous driving with the F1TENTH vehicle. The F1TENTH car fills the gap between research platforms and low-end toy cars and offers hands-on experience in learning the topics in autonomous systems. Four universities have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses for multiple years. Student feedback is used to analyze the effectiveness of the F1TENTH platform. More than 80% of the students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules greatly motivate their learning, and more than 70% of the students strongly agree that the hardware-enhanced their understanding of the subjects. The survey results show that more than 80% of the students strongly agree that the competitions motivate them for the course.
