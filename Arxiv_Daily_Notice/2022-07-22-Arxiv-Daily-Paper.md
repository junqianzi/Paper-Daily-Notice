 - **Abstract**
 Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that offer advantages over traditional cameras. They work asynchronously, sampling the scene with microsecond resolution and producing a stream of brightness changes. This unconventional output has sparked novel computer vision methods to unlock the camera's potential. We tackle the problem of event-based stereo 3D reconstruction for SLAM. Most event-based stereo methods try to exploit the camera's high temporal resolution and event simultaneity across cameras to establish matches and estimate depth. By contrast, we investigate how to estimate depth without explicit data association by fusing Disparity Space Images (DSIs) originated in efficient monocular methods. We develop fusion theory and apply it to design multi-camera 3D reconstruction algorithms that produce state-of-the-art results, as we confirm by comparing against four baseline methods and testing on a variety of available datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 While camera and LiDAR are widely used in most of the assisted and autonomous driving systems, only a few works have been proposed to associate the temporal synchronization and extrinsic calibration for camera and LiDAR which are dedicated to online sensors data fusion. The temporal and spatial calibration technologies are facing the challenges of lack of relevance and real-time. In this paper, we introduce the pose estimation model and environmental robust line features extraction to improve the relevance of data fusion and instant online ability of correction. Dynamic targets eliminating aims to seek optimal policy considering the correspondence of point cloud matching between adjacent moments. The searching optimization process aims to provide accurate parameters with both computation accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the benefits of this method, we evaluate it on the KITTI benchmark with ground truth value. In online experiments, our approach improves the accuracy by 38.5\% than the soft synchronization method in temporal calibration. While in spatial calibration, our approach automatically corrects disturbance errors within 0.4 second and achieves an accuracy of 0.3-degree. This work can promote the research and application of sensor fusion.

 - **Abstract**
 Novel view synthesis has recently been revolutionized by learning neural radiance fields directly from sparse observations. However, rendering images with this new paradigm is slow due to the fact that an accurate quadrature of the volume rendering equation requires a large number of samples for each ray. Previous work has mainly focused on speeding up the network evaluations that are associated with each sample point, e.g., via caching of radiance values into explicit spatial data structures, but this comes at the expense of model compactness. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-network architecture that takes an orthogonal direction by learning how to best reduce the number of required sample points. To this end, we split our network into a sampling and shading network that are jointly trained. Our training scheme employs fixed sample positions along each ray, and incrementally introduces sparsity throughout training to achieve high quality even at low sample counts. After fine-tuning with the target number of samples, the resulting compact neural representation can be rendered in real-time. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms concurrent compact neural representations in terms of quality and frame rate and performs on par with highly efficient hybrid representations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural rendering has received tremendous attention since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and has pushed the state-of-the-art on novel-view synthesis considerably. The recent focus has been on models that overfit to a single scene, and the few attempts to learn models that can synthesize novel views of unseen scenes mostly consist of combining deep convolutional features with a NeRF-like model. We propose a different paradigm, where no deep features and no NeRF-like volume rendering are needed. Our method is capable of predicting the color of a target ray in a novel scene directly, just from a collection of patches sampled from the scene. We first leverage epipolar geometry to extract patches along the epipolar lines of each reference view. Each patch is linearly projected into a 1D feature vector and a sequence of transformers process the collection. For positional encoding, we parameterize rays as in a light field representation, with the crucial difference that the coordinates are canonicalized with respect to the target ray, which makes our method independent of the reference frame and improves generalization. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on novel view synthesis of unseen scenes even when being trained with considerably less data than prior work.

### Mixed-Precision Inference Quantization: Radically Towards Faster  inference speed, Lower Storage requirement, and Lower Loss
 - **Authors:** Daning Cheng, Wenguang Chen

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10083
 - **Abstract**
 Based on the model's resilience to computational noise, model quantization is important for compressing models and improving computing speed. Existing quantization techniques rely heavily on experience and "fine-tuning" skills. In the majority of instances, the quantization model has a larger loss than a full precision model. This study provides a methodology for acquiring a mixed-precise quantization model with a lower loss than the full precision model. In addition, the analysis demonstrates that, throughout the inference process, the loss function is mostly affected by the noise of the layer inputs. In particular, we will demonstrate that neural networks with massive identity mappings are resistant to the quantization method. It is also difficult to improve the performance of these networks using quantization.

 - **Abstract**
 Generative models for audio-conditioned dance motion synthesis map music features to dance movements. Models are trained to associate motion patterns to audio patterns, usually without an explicit knowledge of the human body. This approach relies on a few assumptions: strong music-dance correlation, controlled motion data and relatively simple poses and movements. These characteristics are found in all existing datasets for dance motion synthesis, and indeed recent methods can achieve good results.We introduce a new dataset aiming to challenge these common assumptions, compiling a set of dynamic dance sequences displaying complex human poses. We focus on breakdancing which features acrobatic moves and tangled postures. We source our data from the Red Bull BC One competition videos. Estimating human keypoints from these videos is difficult due to the complexity of the dance, as well as the multiple moving cameras recording setup. We adopt a hybrid labelling pipeline leveraging deep estimation models as well as manual annotations to obtain good quality keypoint sequences at a reduced cost. Our efforts produced the BRACE dataset, which contains over 3 hours and 30 minutes of densely annotated poses. We test state-of-the-art methods on BRACE, showing their limitations when evaluated on complex sequences. Our dataset can readily foster advance in dance motion synthesis. With intricate poses and swift movements, models are forced to go beyond learning a mapping between modalities and reason more effectively about body structure and movements.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10150
 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning models fail to perform well on real-world applications when 1) the category distribution P(Y) of the training dataset suffers from long-tailed distribution and 2) the test data is drawn from different conditional distributions P(X|Y). Existing approaches cannot handle the scenario where both issues exist, which however is common for real-world applications. In this study, we took a step forward and looked into the problem of long-tailed classification under domain shifts. We designed three novel core functional blocks including Distribution Calibrated Classification Loss, Visual-Semantic Mapping and Semantic-Similarity Guided Augmentation. Furthermore, we adopted a meta-learning framework which integrates these three blocks to improve domain generalization on unseen target domains. Two new datasets were proposed for this problem, named AWA2-LTS and ImageNet-LTS. We evaluated our method on the two datasets and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art long-tailed/domain generalization approaches and the combinations. Source codes and datasets can be found at our project page https://xiaogu.site/LTDS.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper focuses on waveform design for joint radar and communication systems and presents a new subset selection process to improve the communication error rate performance and global accuracy of radar sensing of the random stepped frequency permutation waveform. An optimal communication receiver based on integer programming is proposed to handle any subset of permutations followed by a more efficient sub-optimal receiver based on the Hungarian algorithm. Considering optimum maximum likelihood detection, the block error rate is analyzed under both additive white Gaussian noise and correlated Rician fading. We propose two methods to select a permutation subset with an improved block error rate and an efficient encoding scheme to map the information symbols to selected permutations under these subsets. From the radar perspective, the ambiguity function is analyzed with regards to the local and the global accuracy of target detection. Furthermore, a subset selection method to reduce the maximum sidelobe height is proposed by extending the properties of Costas arrays. Finally, the process of remapping the frequency tones to the symbol set used to generate permutations is introduced as a method to improve both the communication and radar performances of the selected permutation subset.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its low annotation cost in real applications. Recent studies leverage the advantage of self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active semantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class activation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer neglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses the semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization results significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we introduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate WSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial relationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial context intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is designed as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during inference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization ability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through optimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to capture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant background area. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which significantly outperforms its counterpart TS-CAM on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/164140757/SCM.

 - **Abstract**
 When learning disconnected distributions, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are known to face model misspecification. Indeed, a continuous mapping from a unimodal latent distribution to a disconnected one is impossible, so GANs necessarily generate samples outside of the support of the target distribution. This raises a fundamental question: what is the latent space partition that minimizes the measure of these areas? Building on a recent result of geometric measure theory, we prove that an optimal GANs must structure its latent space as a 'simplicial cluster' - a Voronoi partition where cells are convex cones - when the dimension of the latent space is larger than the number of modes. In this configuration, each Voronoi cell maps to a distinct mode of the data. We derive both an upper and a lower bound on the optimal precision of GANs learning disconnected manifolds. Interestingly, these two bounds have the same order of decrease: $\sqrt{\log m}$, $m$ being the number of modes. Finally, we perform several experiments to exhibit the geometry of the latent space and experimentally show that GANs have a geometry with similar properties to the theoretical one.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10222
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10222
 - **Abstract**
 Direct localization (DLOC) methods, which use the observed data to localize a source at an unknown position in a one-step procedure, generally outperform their indirect two-step counterparts (e.g., using time-difference of arrivals). However, underwater acoustic DLOC methods require prior knowledge of the environment, and are computationally costly, hence slow. We propose, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first data-driven DLOC method. Inspired by classical and contemporary optimal model-based DLOC solutions, and leveraging the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we devise a holistic CNN-based solution. Our method includes a specifically-tailored input structure, architecture, loss function, and a progressive training procedure, which are of independent interest in the broader context of machine learning. We demonstrate that our method outperforms attractive alternatives, and asymptotically matches the performance of an oracle optimal model-based solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to learn representations that encode object location using only image-level category labels. However, many objects can be labeled at different levels of granularity. Is it an animal, a bird, or a great horned owl? Which image-level labels should we use? In this paper we study the role of label granularity in WSOL. To facilitate this investigation we introduce iNatLoc500, a new large-scale fine-grained benchmark dataset for WSOL. Surprisingly, we find that choosing the right training label granularity provides a much larger performance boost than choosing the best WSOL algorithm. We also show that changing the label granularity can significantly improve data efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, deep learning-based visual inspection has been highly successful with the help of supervised learning methods. However, in real industrial scenarios, the scarcity of defect samples, the cost of annotation, and the lack of a priori knowledge of defects may render supervised-based methods ineffective. In recent years, unsupervised anomaly localization algorithms have become more widely used in industrial inspection tasks. This paper aims to help researchers in this field by comprehensively surveying recent achievements in unsupervised anomaly localization in industrial images using deep learning. The survey reviews more than 120 significant publications covering different aspects of anomaly localization, mainly covering various concepts, challenges, taxonomies, benchmark datasets, and quantitative performance comparisons of the methods reviewed. In reviewing the achievements to date, this paper provides detailed predictions and analysis of several future research directions. This review provides detailed technical information for researchers interested in industrial anomaly localization and who wish to apply it to the localization of anomalies in other fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Point clouds and RGB images are two general perceptional sources in autonomous driving. The former can provide accurate localization of objects, and the latter is denser and richer in semantic information. Recently, AutoAlign presents a learnable paradigm in combining these two modalities for 3D object detection. However, it suffers from high computational cost introduced by the global-wise attention. To solve the problem, we propose Cross-Domain DeformCAFA module in this work. It attends to sparse learnable sampling points for cross-modal relational modeling, which enhances the tolerance to calibration error and greatly speeds up the feature aggregation across different modalities. To overcome the complex GT-AUG under multi-modal settings, we design a simple yet effective cross-modal augmentation strategy on convex combination of image patches given their depth information. Moreover, by carrying out a novel image-level dropout training scheme, our model is able to infer in a dynamic manner. To this end, we propose AutoAlignV2, a faster and stronger multi-modal 3D detection framework, built on top of AutoAlign. Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoAlignV2. Notably, our best model reaches 72.4 NDS on nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art results among all published multi-modal 3D object detectors. Code will be available at https://github.com/zehuichen123/AutoAlignV2.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the task of person search, that is, localizing and re-identifying query persons from a set of raw scene images. Recent approaches are typically built upon OIMNet, a pioneer work on person search, that learns joint person representations for performing both detection and person re-identification (reID) tasks. To obtain the representations, they extract features from pedestrian proposals, and then project them on a unit hypersphere with L2 normalization. These methods also incorporate all positive proposals, that sufficiently overlap with the ground truth, equally to learn person representations for reID. We have found that 1) the L2 normalization without considering feature distributions degenerates the discriminative power of person representations, and 2) positive proposals often also depict background clutter and person overlaps, which could encode noisy features to person representations. In this paper, we introduce OIMNet++ that addresses the aforementioned limitations. To this end, we introduce a novel normalization layer, dubbed ProtoNorm, that calibrates features from pedestrian proposals, while considering a long-tail distribution of person IDs, enabling L2 normalized person representations to be discriminative. We also propose a localization-aware feature learning scheme that encourages better-aligned proposals to contribute more in learning discriminative representations. Experimental results and analysis on standard person search benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OIMNet++.
### LocVTP: Video-Text Pre-training for Temporal Localization

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10362
 - **Abstract**
 Video-Text Pre-training (VTP) aims to learn transferable representations for various downstream tasks from large-scale web videos. To date, almost all existing VTP methods are limited to retrieval-based downstream tasks, e.g., video retrieval, whereas their transfer potentials on localization-based tasks, e.g., temporal grounding, are under-explored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze and demonstrate the incompatibility of current VTP methods with localization tasks, and propose a novel Localization-oriented Video-Text Pre-training framework, dubbed as LocVTP. Specifically, we perform the fine-grained contrastive alignment as a complement to the coarse-grained one by a clip-word correspondence discovery scheme. To further enhance the temporal reasoning ability of the learned feature, we propose a context projection head and a temporal aware contrastive loss to perceive the contextual relationships. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks across six datasets demonstrate that our LocVTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both retrieval-based and localization-based tasks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and thorough analyses to explore the optimum model designs and training strategies.
### Correspondence Matters for Video Referring Expression Comprehension

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10400
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10400
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the problem of video Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to localize the referent objects described in the sentence to visual regions in the video frames. Despite the recent progress, existing methods suffer from two problems: 1) inconsistent localization results across video frames; 2) confusion between the referent and contextual objects. To this end, we propose a novel Dual Correspondence Network (dubbed as DCNet) which explicitly enhances the dense associations in both the inter-frame and cross-modal manners. Firstly, we aim to build the inter-frame correlations for all existing instances within the frames. Specifically, we compute the inter-frame patch-wise cosine similarity to estimate the dense alignment and then perform the inter-frame contrastive learning to map them close in feature space. Secondly, we propose to build the fine-grained patch-word alignment to associate each patch with certain words. Due to the lack of this kind of detailed annotations, we also predict the patch-word correspondence through the cosine similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both video and image REC benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and thorough analyses to explore the optimal model designs. Notably, our inter-frame and cross-modal contrastive losses are plug-and-play functions and are applicable to any video REC architectures. For example, by building on top of Co-grounding, we boost the performance by 1.48% absolute improvement on Accu.@0.5 for VID-Sentence dataset.

 The task of action detection aims at deducing both the action category and localization of the start and end moment for each action instance in a long, untrimmed video. While vision Transformers have driven the recent advances in video understanding, it is non-trivial to design an efficient architecture for action detection due to the prohibitively expensive self-attentions over a long sequence of video clips. To this end, we present an efficient hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Pyramid Transformer (STPT) for action detection, building upon the fact that the early self-attention layers in Transformers still focus on local patterns. Specifically, we propose to use local window attention to encode rich local spatio-temporal representations in the early stages while applying global attention modules to capture long-term space-time dependencies in the later stages. In this way, our STPT can encode both locality and dependency with largely reduced redundancy, delivering a promising trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. For example, with only RGB input, the proposed STPT achieves 53.6% mAP on THUMOS14, surpassing I3D+AFSD RGB model by over 10% and performing favorably against state-of-the-art AFSD that uses additional flow features with 31% fewer GFLOPs, which serves as an effective and efficient end-to-end Transformer-based framework for action detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The conventional room geometry blind inference techniques with acoustic signals are conducted based on the prior knowledge of the environment, such as the room impulse response (RIR) or the sound source position, which will limit its application under known scenarios. To solve this problem, we have proposed a room geometry reconstruction method in this paper by using the geometric relation between the direct signal and first-order reflections. In addition to the information of the compact microphone array itself, this method does not need any precognition of the environmental parameters. Besides, the learning-based DNN models are designed and used to improve the accuracy and integrity of the localization results of the direct source and first-order reflections. The direction of arrival (DOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) information of the direct and reflected signals are firstly estimated using the proposed DCNN and TD-CNN models, which have higher sensitivity and accuracy than the conventional methods. Then the position of the sound source is inferred by integrating the DOA, TDOA and array height using the proposed DNN model. After that, the positions of image sources and corresponding boundaries are derived based on the geometric relation. Experimental results of both simulations and real measurements verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed techniques compared with the conventional methods under different reverberant environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, significant progress has been achieved for 3D object detection on point clouds thanks to the advances in 3D data collection and deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, 3D scenes exhibit a lot of variations and are prone to sensor inaccuracies as well as information loss during pre-processing. Thus, it is crucial to design techniques that are robust against these variations. This requires a detailed analysis and understanding of the effect of such variations. This work aims to analyze and benchmark popular point-based 3D object detectors against several data corruptions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the robustness of point-based 3D object detectors. To this end, we design and evaluate corruptions that involve data addition, reduction, and alteration. We further study the robustness of different modules against local and global variations. Our experimental results reveal several intriguing findings. For instance, we show that methods that integrate Transformers at a patch or object level lead to increased robustness, compared to using Transformers at the point level.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, self-supervised pre-training has advanced Vision Transformers on various tasks w.r.t. different data modalities, e.g., image and 3D point cloud data. In this paper, we explore this learning paradigm for 3D mesh data analysis based on Transformers. Since applying Transformer architectures to new modalities is usually non-trivial, we first adapt Vision Transformer to 3D mesh data processing, i.e., Mesh Transformer. In specific, we divide a mesh into several non-overlapping local patches with each containing the same number of faces and use the 3D position of each patch's center point to form positional embeddings. Inspired by MAE, we explore how pre-training on 3D mesh data with the Transformer-based structure benefits downstream 3D mesh analysis tasks. We first randomly mask some patches of the mesh and feed the corrupted mesh into Mesh Transformers. Then, through reconstructing the information of masked patches, the network is capable of learning discriminative representations for mesh data. Therefore, we name our method MeshMAE, which can yield state-of-the-art or comparable performance on mesh analysis tasks, i.e., classification and segmentation. In addition, we also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to show the effectiveness of key designs in our method.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent isotropic networks, such as ConvMixer and vision transformers, have found significant success across visual recognition tasks, matching or outperforming non-isotropic convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Isotropic architectures are particularly well-suited to cross-layer weight sharing, an effective neural network compression technique. In this paper, we perform an empirical evaluation on methods for sharing parameters in isotropic networks (SPIN). We present a framework to formalize major weight sharing design decisions and perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of this design space. Guided by our experimental results, we propose a weight sharing strategy to generate a family of models with better overall efficiency, in terms of FLOPs and parameters versus accuracy, compared to traditional scaling methods alone, for example compressing ConvMixer by 1.9x while improving accuracy on ImageNet. Finally, we perform a qualitative study to further understand the behavior of weight sharing in isotropic architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-spin.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting and mitigating harmful biases in modern language models are widely recognized as crucial, open problems. In this paper, we take a step back and investigate how language models come to be biased in the first place. We use a relatively small language model, using the LSTM architecture trained on an English Wikipedia corpus. With full access to the data and to the model parameters as they change during every step while training, we can map in detail how the representation of gender develops, what patterns in the dataset drive this, and how the model's internal state relates to the bias in a downstream task (semantic textual similarity). We find that the representation of gender is dynamic and identify different phases during training. Furthermore, we show that gender information is represented increasingly locally in the input embeddings of the model and that, as a consequence, debiasing these can be effective in reducing the downstream bias. Monitoring the training dynamics, allows us to detect an asymmetry in how the female and male gender are represented in the input embeddings. This is important, as it may cause naive mitigation strategies to introduce new undesirable biases. We discuss the relevance of the findings for mitigation strategies more generally and the prospects of generalizing our methods to larger language models, the Transformer architecture, other languages and other undesirable biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Text removal has attracted increasingly attention due to its various applications on privacy protection, document restoration, and text editing. It has shown significant progress with deep neural network. However, most of the existing methods often generate inconsistent results for complex background. To address this issue, we propose a Contextual-guided Text Removal Network, termed as CTRNet. CTRNet explores both low-level structure and high-level discriminative context feature as prior knowledge to guide the process of background restoration. We further propose a Local-global Content Modeling (LGCM) block with CNNs and Transformer-Encoder to capture local features and establish the long-term relationship among pixels globally. Finally, we incorporate LGCM with context guidance for feature modeling and decoding. Experiments on benchmark datasets, SCUT-EnsText and SCUT-Syn show that CTRNet significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, a qualitative experiment on examination papers also demonstrates the generalization ability of our method.

 - **Abstract**
 Transformers have emerged as a preferred model for many tasks in natural langugage processing and vision. Recent efforts on training and deploying Transformers more efficiently have identified many strategies to approximate the self-attention matrix, a key module in a Transformer architecture. Effective ideas include various prespecified sparsity patterns, low-rank basis expansions and combinations thereof. In this paper, we revisit classical Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) concepts such as Wavelets, whose potential value in this setting remains underexplored thus far. We show that simple approximations based on empirical feedback and design choices informed by modern hardware and implementation challenges, eventually yield a MRA-based approach for self-attention with an excellent performance profile across most criteria of interest. We undertake an extensive set of experiments and demonstrate that this multi-resolution scheme outperforms most efficient self-attention proposals and is favorable for both short and long sequences.

 - **Abstract**
 Impressive results in natural language processing (NLP) based on the Transformer neural network architecture have inspired researchers to explore viewing offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a generic sequence modeling problem. Recent works based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus, in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We demonstrate our method's superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving tasks in simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Point cloud completion has become increasingly popular among generation tasks of 3D point clouds, as it is a challenging yet indispensable problem to recover the complete shape of a 3D object from its partial observation. In this paper, we propose a novel SeedFormer to improve the ability of detail preservation and recovery in point cloud completion. Unlike previous methods based on a global feature vector, we introduce a new shape representation, namely Patch Seeds, which not only captures general structures from partial inputs but also preserves regional information of local patterns. Then, by integrating seed features into the generation process, we can recover faithful details for complete point clouds in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, we devise an Upsample Transformer by extending the transformer structure into basic operations of point generators, which effectively incorporates spatial and semantic relationships between neighboring points. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks on several benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrzhou2/seedformer.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing works on 2D pose estimation mainly focus on a certain category, e.g. human, animal, and vehicle. However, there are lots of application scenarios that require detecting the poses/keypoints of the unseen class of objects. In this paper, we introduce the task of Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE), which aims to create a pose estimation model capable of detecting the pose of any class of object given only a few samples with keypoint definition. To achieve this goal, we formulate the pose estimation problem as a keypoint matching problem and design a novel CAPE framework, termed POse Matching Network (POMNet). A transformer-based Keypoint Interaction Module (KIM) is proposed to capture both the interactions among different keypoints and the relationship between the support and query images. We also introduce Multi-category Pose (MP-100) dataset, which is a 2D pose dataset of 100 object categories containing over 20K instances and is well-designed for developing CAPE algorithms. Experiments show that our method outperforms other baseline approaches by a large margin. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/luminxu/Pose-for-Everything.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the problem of task-agnostic feature upsampling in dense prediction where an upsampling operator is required to facilitate both region-sensitive tasks like semantic segmentation and detail-sensitive tasks such as image matting. Existing upsampling operators often can work well in either type of the tasks, but not both. In this work, we present FADE, a novel, plug-and-play, and task-agnostic upsampling operator. FADE benefits from three design choices: i) considering encoder and decoder features jointly in upsampling kernel generation; ii) an efficient semi-shift convolutional operator that enables granular control over how each feature point contributes to upsampling kernels; iii) a decoder-dependent gating mechanism for enhanced detail delineation. We first study the upsampling properties of FADE on toy data and then evaluate it on large-scale semantic segmentation and image matting. In particular, FADE reveals its effectiveness and task-agnostic characteristic by consistently outperforming recent dynamic upsampling operators in different tasks. It also generalizes well across convolutional and transformer architectures with little computational overhead. Our work additionally provides thoughtful insights on what makes for task-agnostic upsampling. Code is available at: this http URL

 - **Abstract**
 Drone detection has become an essential task in object detection as drone costs have decreased and drone technology has improved. It is, however, difficult to detect distant drones when there is weak contrast, long range, and low visibility. In this work, we propose several sequence classification architectures to reduce the detected false-positive ratio of drone tracks. Moreover, we propose a new drone vs. bird sequence classification dataset to train and evaluate the proposed architectures. 3D CNN, LSTM, and Transformer based sequence classification architectures have been trained on the proposed dataset to show the effectiveness of the proposed idea. As experiments show, using sequence information, bird classification and overall F1 scores can be increased by up to 73% and 35%, respectively. Among all sequence classification models, R(2+1)D-based fully convolutional model yields the best transfer learning and fine-tuning results.
### A Wavelet Transform and self-supervised learning-based framework for  bearing fault diagnosis with limited labeled data

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional supervised bearing fault diagnosis methods rely on massive labelled data, yet annotations may be very time-consuming or infeasible. The fault diagnosis approach that utilizes limited labelled data is becoming increasingly popular. In this paper, a Wavelet Transform (WT) and self-supervised learning-based bearing fault diagnosis framework is proposed to address the lack of supervised samples issue. Adopting the WT and cubic spline interpolation technique, original measured vibration signals are converted to the time-frequency maps (TFMs) with a fixed scale as inputs. The Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed as the encoder for feature extraction, and the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) algorithm is introduced in the proposed framework for self-supervised learning with limited labelled data and sufficient unlabeled data. Two rolling bearing fault datasets are used for validations. In the case of both datasets only containing 1% labelled samples, utilizing the feature vectors extracted by the trained encoder without fine-tuning, over 90\% average diagnosis accuracy can be obtained based on the simple K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated in comparison with other self-supervised fault diagnosis methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its low annotation cost in real applications. Recent studies leverage the advantage of self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active semantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class activation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer neglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses the semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization results significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we introduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate WSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial relationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial context intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is designed as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during inference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization ability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through optimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to capture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant background area. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which significantly outperforms its counterpart TS-CAM on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/164140757/SCM.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer have achieved great success in multimedia applications. However, little effort has been made to effectively and efficiently harmonize these two architectures to satisfy image deraining. This paper aims to unify these two architectures to take advantage of their learning merits for image deraining. In particular, the local connectivity and translation equivariance of CNN and the global aggregation ability of self-attention (SA) in Transformer are fully exploited for specific local context and global structure representations. Based on the observation that rain distribution reveals the degradation location and degree, we introduce degradation prior to help background recovery and accordingly present the association refinement deraining scheme. A novel multi-input attention module (MAM) is proposed to associate rain perturbation removal and background recovery. Moreover, we equip our model with effective depth-wise separable convolutions to learn the specific feature representations and trade off computational complexity. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method (dubbed as ELF) outperforms the state-of-the-art approach (MPRNet) by 0.25 dB on average, but only accounts for 11.7\% and 42.1\% of its computational cost and parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision Transformer (ViT), as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has received much attention. Recent work showed that ViTs are also vulnerable to adversarial examples like CNNs. To build robust ViTs, an intuitive way is to apply adversarial training since it has been shown as one of the most effective ways to accomplish robust CNNs. However, one major limitation of adversarial training is its heavy computational cost. The self-attention mechanism adopted by ViTs is a computationally intense operation whose expense increases quadratically with the number of input patches, making adversarial training on ViTs even more time-consuming. In this work, we first comprehensively study fast adversarial training on a variety of vision transformers and illustrate the relationship between the efficiency and robustness. Then, to expediate adversarial training on ViTs, we propose an efficient Attention Guided Adversarial Training mechanism. Specifically, relying on the specialty of self-attention, we actively remove certain patch embeddings of each layer with an attention-guided dropping strategy during adversarial training. The slimmed self-attention modules accelerate the adversarial training on ViTs significantly. With only 65\% of the fast adversarial training time, we match the state-of-the-art results on the challenging ImageNet benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-horizon probabilistic time series forecasting has wide applicability to real-world tasks such as demand forecasting. Recent work in neural time-series forecasting mainly focus on the use of Seq2Seq architectures. For example, MQTransformer - an improvement of MQCNN - has shown the state-of-the-art performance in probabilistic demand forecasting. In this paper, we consider incorporating cross-entity information to enhance model performance by adding a cross-entity attention mechanism along with a retrieval mechanism to select which entities to attend over. We demonstrate how our new neural architecture, MQRetNN, leverages the encoded contexts from a pretrained baseline model on the entire population to improve forecasting accuracy. Using MQCNN as the baseline model (due to computational constraints, we do not use MQTransformer), we first show on a small demand forecasting dataset that it is possible to achieve ~3% improvement in test loss by adding a cross-entity attention mechanism where each entity attends to all others in the population. We then evaluate the model with our proposed retrieval methods - as a means of approximating an attention over a large population - on a large-scale demand forecasting application with over 2 million products and observe ~1% performance gain over the MQCNN baseline.

 - **Abstract**
 There have been a lot of interest in the scaling properties of Transformer models. However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the effect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model architectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does inductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream (pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study of scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers, Switch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers, and recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1) architecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling and (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales. We believe that the findings outlined in this work has significant implications to how model architectures are currently evaluated in the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-training has shown success in different areas of machine learning, such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and medical imaging. However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. An immense amount of clinical records are recorded, but still, data and labels can be scarce for data collected in small hospitals or dealing with rare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of unlabelled clinical data could improve performance. In this paper, we propose novel unsupervised pre-training techniques designed for heterogeneous, multi-modal clinical data for patient outcome prediction inspired by masked language modeling (MLM), by leveraging graph deep learning over population graphs. To this end, we further propose a graph-transformer-based network, designed to handle heterogeneous clinical data. By combining masking-based pre-training with a transformer-based network, we translate the success of masking-based pre-training in other domains to heterogeneous clinical data. We show the benefit of our pre-training method in a self-supervised and a transfer learning setting, utilizing three medical datasets TADPOLE, MIMIC-III, and a Sepsis Prediction Dataset. We find that our proposed pre-training methods help in modeling the data at a patient and population level and improve performance in different fine-tuning tasks on all datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural rendering has received tremendous attention since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and has pushed the state-of-the-art on novel-view synthesis considerably. The recent focus has been on models that overfit to a single scene, and the few attempts to learn models that can synthesize novel views of unseen scenes mostly consist of combining deep convolutional features with a NeRF-like model. We propose a different paradigm, where no deep features and no NeRF-like volume rendering are needed. Our method is capable of predicting the color of a target ray in a novel scene directly, just from a collection of patches sampled from the scene. We first leverage epipolar geometry to extract patches along the epipolar lines of each reference view. Each patch is linearly projected into a 1D feature vector and a sequence of transformers process the collection. For positional encoding, we parameterize rays as in a light field representation, with the crucial difference that the coordinates are canonicalized with respect to the target ray, which makes our method independent of the reference frame and improves generalization. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on novel view synthesis of unseen scenes even when being trained with considerably less data than prior work.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new benchmark dataset, Sapsucker Woods 60 (SSW60), for advancing research on audiovisual fine-grained categorization. While our community has made great strides in fine-grained visual categorization on images, the counterparts in audio and video fine-grained categorization are relatively unexplored. To encourage advancements in this space, we have carefully constructed the SSW60 dataset to enable researchers to experiment with classifying the same set of categories in three different modalities: images, audio, and video. The dataset covers 60 species of birds and is comprised of images from existing datasets, and brand new, expert-curated audio and video datasets. We thoroughly benchmark audiovisual classification performance and modality fusion experiments through the use of state-of-the-art transformer methods. Our findings show that performance of audiovisual fusion methods is better than using exclusively image or audio based methods for the task of video classification. We also present interesting modality transfer experiments, enabled by the unique construction of SSW60 to encompass three different modalities. We hope the SSW60 dataset and accompanying baselines spur research in this fascinating area.

 - **Abstract**
 Vision transformer (ViT) recently has drawn great attention in computer vision due to its remarkable model capability. However, most prevailing ViT models suffer from huge number of parameters, restricting their applicability on devices with limited resources. To alleviate this issue, we propose TinyViT, a new family of tiny and efficient small vision transformers pretrained on large-scale datasets with our proposed fast distillation framework. The central idea is to transfer knowledge from large pretrained models to small ones, while enabling small models to get the dividends of massive pretraining data. More specifically, we apply distillation during pretraining for knowledge transfer. The logits of large teacher models are sparsified and stored in disk in advance to save the memory cost and computation overheads. The tiny student transformers are automatically scaled down from a large pretrained model with computation and parameter constraints. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TinyViT. It achieves a top-1 accuracy of 84.8% on ImageNet-1k with only 21M parameters, being comparable to Swin-B pretrained on ImageNet-21k while using 4.2 times fewer parameters. Moreover, increasing image resolutions, TinyViT can reach 86.5% accuracy, being slightly better than Swin-L while using only 11% parameters. Last but not the least, we demonstrate a good transfer ability of TinyViT on various downstream tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/TinyViT.

 Predictive uncertainty estimation is essential for deploying Deep Neural Networks in real-world autonomous systems. However, most successful approaches are computationally intensive. In this work, we attempt to address these challenges in the context of autonomous driving perception tasks. Recently proposed Deterministic Uncertainty Methods (DUM) can only partially meet such requirements as their scalability to complex computer vision tasks is not obvious. In this work we advance a scalable and effective DUM for high-resolution semantic segmentation, that relaxes the Lipschitz constraint typically hindering practicality of such architectures. We learn a discriminant latent space by leveraging a distinction maximization layer over an arbitrarily-sized set of trainable prototypes. Our approach achieves competitive results over Deep Ensembles, the state-of-the-art for uncertainty prediction, on image classification, segmentation and monocular depth estimation tasks.

 Each year, thousands of people learn new visual categorization tasks -- radiologists learn to recognize tumors, birdwatchers learn to distinguish similar species, and crowd workers learn how to annotate valuable data for applications like autonomous driving. As humans learn, their brain updates the visual features it extracts and attend to, which ultimately informs their final classification decisions. In this work, we propose a novel task of tracing the evolving classification behavior of human learners as they engage in challenging visual classification tasks. We propose models that jointly extract the visual features used by learners as well as predicting the classification functions they utilize. We collect three challenging new datasets from real human learners in order to evaluate the performance of different visual knowledge tracing methods. Our results show that our recurrent models are able to predict the classification behavior of human learners on three challenging medical image and species identification tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Impressive results in natural language processing (NLP) based on the Transformer neural network architecture have inspired researchers to explore viewing offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a generic sequence modeling problem. Recent works based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus, in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We demonstrate our method's superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving tasks in simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Point clouds and RGB images are two general perceptional sources in autonomous driving. The former can provide accurate localization of objects, and the latter is denser and richer in semantic information. Recently, AutoAlign presents a learnable paradigm in combining these two modalities for 3D object detection. However, it suffers from high computational cost introduced by the global-wise attention. To solve the problem, we propose Cross-Domain DeformCAFA module in this work. It attends to sparse learnable sampling points for cross-modal relational modeling, which enhances the tolerance to calibration error and greatly speeds up the feature aggregation across different modalities. To overcome the complex GT-AUG under multi-modal settings, we design a simple yet effective cross-modal augmentation strategy on convex combination of image patches given their depth information. Moreover, by carrying out a novel image-level dropout training scheme, our model is able to infer in a dynamic manner. To this end, we propose AutoAlignV2, a faster and stronger multi-modal 3D detection framework, built on top of AutoAlign. Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoAlignV2. Notably, our best model reaches 72.4 NDS on nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art results among all published multi-modal 3D object detectors. Code will be available at https://github.com/zehuichen123/AutoAlignV2.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the future states of surrounding traffic participants and planning a safe, smooth, and socially compliant trajectory accordingly is crucial for autonomous vehicles. There are two major issues with the current autonomous driving system: the prediction module is often decoupled from the planning module and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. To tackle these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable framework that integrates prediction and planning modules and is able to learn the cost function from data. Specifically, we employ a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner, which takes the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents given by the neural network as input and optimizes the trajectory for the autonomous vehicle, thus enabling all operations in the framework to be differentiable including the cost function weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving dataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and validated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing the planning module to output close-to-human trajectories. In closed-loop testing, the proposed method shows the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness against the distributional shift that imitation learning methods suffer from. Importantly, we find that joint training of planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with a separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests. Moreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the framework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance.

 - **Abstract**
 The perceptive models of autonomous driving require fast inference within a low latency for safety. While existing works ignore the inevitable environmental changes after processing, streaming perception jointly evaluates the latency and accuracy into a single metric for video online perception, guiding the previous works to search trade-offs between accuracy and speed. In this paper, we explore the performance of real time models on this metric and endow the models with the capacity of predicting the future, significantly improving the results for streaming perception. Specifically, we build a simple framework with two effective modules. One is a Dual Flow Perception module (DFP). It consists of dynamic flow and static flow in parallel to capture moving tendency and basic detection feature, respectively. Trend Aware Loss (TAL) is the other module which adaptively generates loss weight for each object with its moving speed. Realistically, we consider multiple velocities driving scene and further propose Velocity-awared streaming AP (VsAP) to jointly evaluate the accuracy. In this realistic setting, we design a efficient mix-velocity training strategy to guide detector perceive any velocities. Our simple method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse-HD dataset and improves the sAP and VsAP by 4.7% and 8.2% respectively compared to the strong baseline, validating its effectiveness.

 - **Abstract**
 While camera and LiDAR are widely used in most of the assisted and autonomous driving systems, only a few works have been proposed to associate the temporal synchronization and extrinsic calibration for camera and LiDAR which are dedicated to online sensors data fusion. The temporal and spatial calibration technologies are facing the challenges of lack of relevance and real-time. In this paper, we introduce the pose estimation model and environmental robust line features extraction to improve the relevance of data fusion and instant online ability of correction. Dynamic targets eliminating aims to seek optimal policy considering the correspondence of point cloud matching between adjacent moments. The searching optimization process aims to provide accurate parameters with both computation accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the benefits of this method, we evaluate it on the KITTI benchmark with ground truth value. In online experiments, our approach improves the accuracy by 38.5\% than the soft synchronization method in temporal calibration. While in spatial calibration, our approach automatically corrects disturbance errors within 0.4 second and achieves an accuracy of 0.3-degree. This work can promote the research and application of sensor fusion.
