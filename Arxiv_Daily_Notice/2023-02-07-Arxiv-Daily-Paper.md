 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it has become popular to deploy sensors such as LiDARs on the roadside to monitor the passing traffic and assist autonomous vehicle perception. Unlike autonomous vehicle systems, roadside sensors are usually affiliated with different subsystems and lack synchronization both in time and space. Calibration is a key technology which allows the central server to fuse the data generated by different location infrastructures, which can deliver improve the sensing range and detection robustness. Unfortunately, existing calibration algorithms often assume that the LiDARs are significantly overlapped or that the temporal calibration is already achieved. Since these assumptions do not always hold in the real world, the calibration results from the existing algorithms are often unsatisfactory and always need human involvement, which brings high labor costs. In this paper, we propose TrajMatch -- the first system that can automatically calibrate for roadside LiDARs in both time and space. The main idea is to automatically calibrate the sensors based on the result of the detection/tracking task instead of extracting special features. More deeply, we propose a mechanism for evaluating calibration parameters that is consistent with our algorithm, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme experimentally, which can also be used to guide parameter iterations for multiple calibration. Finally, to evaluate the performance of TrajMatch , we collect two dataset, one simulated dataset LiDARnet-sim 1.0 and a real-world dataset. Experiment results show that TrajMatch can achieve a spatial calibration error of less than 10cm and a temporal calibration error of less than 1.5ms.

 - **Abstract**
 The deployment of 3D detectors strikes one of the major challenges in real-world self-driving scenarios. Existing BEV-based (i.e., Bird Eye View) detectors favor sparse convolution (known as SPConv) to speed up training and inference, which puts a hard barrier for deployment especially for on-device applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of efficient 3D object detection from LiDAR point clouds with deployment in mind. To reduce computational burden, we propose a pillar-based 3D detector with high performance from an industry perspective, termed FastPillars. Compared with previous methods, we introduce a more effective Max-and-Attention pillar encoding (MAPE) module, and redesigning a powerful and lightweight backbone CRVNet imbued with Cross Stage Partial network (CSP) in a reparameterization style, forming a compact feature representation framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FastPillars surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D detectors regarding both on-device speed and performance. Specifically, FastPillars can be effectively deployed through TensorRT, obtaining real-time performance (24FPS) on a single RTX3070Ti GPU with 64.6 mAP on the nuScenes test set. Our code will be released.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years fairness in machine learning (ML) has emerged as a highly active area of research and development. Most define fairness in simple terms, where fairness means reducing gaps in performance or outcomes between demographic groups while preserving as much of the accuracy of the original system as possible. This oversimplification of equality through fairness measures is troubling. Many current fairness measures suffer from both fairness and performance degradation, or "levelling down," where fairness is achieved by making every group worse off, or by bringing better performing groups down to the level of the worst off. When fairness can only be achieved by making everyone worse off in material or relational terms through injuries of stigma, loss of solidarity, unequal concern, and missed opportunities for substantive equality, something would appear to have gone wrong in translating the vague concept of 'fairness' into practice. This paper examines the causes and prevalence of levelling down across fairML, and explore possible justifications and criticisms based on philosophical and legal theories of equality and distributive justice, as well as equality law jurisprudence. We find that fairML does not currently engage in the type of measurement, reporting, or analysis necessary to justify levelling down in practice. We propose a first step towards substantive equality in fairML: "levelling up" systems by design through enforcement of minimum acceptable harm thresholds, or "minimum rate constraints," as fairness constraints. We likewise propose an alternative harms-based framework to counter the oversimplified egalitarian framing currently dominant in the field and push future discussion more towards substantive equality opportunities and away from strict egalitarianism by default.

 - **Abstract**
 Transporting large and heavy objects can benefit from Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), increasing the contribution of robots to our daily tasks and reducing the risk of injuries to the human operator. This approach usually posits the human collaborator as the leader, while the robot has the follower role. Hence, it is essential for the leader to be aware of the environmental situation. However, when transporting a large object, the operator's situational awareness can be compromised as the object may occlude different parts of the environment. This paper proposes a novel haptic-based environmental awareness module for a collaborative transportation framework that informs the human operator about surrounding obstacles. The robot uses two LIDARs to detect the obstacles in the surroundings. The warning module alerts the operator through a haptic belt with four vibrotactile devices that provide feedback about the location and proximity of the obstacles. By enhancing the operator's awareness of the surroundings, the proposed module improves the safety of the human-robot team in co-carrying scenarios by preventing collisions. Experiments with two non-expert subjects in two different situations are conducted. The results show that the human partner can successfully lead the co-transportation system in an unknown environment with hidden obstacles thanks to the haptic feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Human perception of the complex world relies on a comprehensive analysis of multi-modal signals, and the co-occurrences of audio and video signals provide humans with rich cues. This paper focuses on novel audio-visual scene synthesis in the real world. Given a video recording of an audio-visual scene, the task is to synthesize new videos with spatial audios along arbitrary novel camera trajectories in that audio-visual scene. Directly using a NeRF-based model for audio synthesis is insufficient due to its lack of prior knowledge and acoustic supervision. To tackle the challenges, we first propose an acoustic-aware audio generation module that integrates our prior knowledge of audio propagation into NeRF, in which we associate audio generation with the 3D geometry of the visual environment. In addition, we propose a coordinate transformation module that expresses a viewing direction relative to the sound source. Such a direction transformation helps the model learn sound source-centric acoustic fields. Moreover, we utilize a head-related impulse response function to synthesize pseudo binaural audio for data augmentation that strengthens training. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of our model on real-world audio-visual scenes. We refer interested readers to view our video results for convincing comparisons.

 - **Abstract**
 Normalizing Flows (NF) are Generative models which are particularly robust and allow for exact sampling of the learned distribution. They however require the design of an invertible mapping, whose Jacobian determinant has to be computable. Recently introduced, Neural Hamiltonian Flows (NHF) are based on Hamiltonian dynamics-based Flows, which are continuous, volume-preserving and invertible and thus make for natural candidates for robust NF architectures. In particular, their similarity to classical Mechanics could lead to easier interpretability of the learned mapping. However, despite being Physics-inspired architectures, the originally introduced NHF architecture still poses a challenge to interpretability. For this reason, in this work, we introduce a fixed kinetic energy version of the NHF model. Inspired by physics, our approach improves interpretability and requires less parameters than previously proposed architectures. We then study the robustness of the NHF architectures to the choice of hyperparameters. We analyze the impact of the number of leapfrog steps, the integration time and the number of neurons per hidden layer, as well as the choice of prior distribution, on sampling a multimodal 2D mixture. The NHF architecture is robust to these choices, especially the fixed-kinetic energy model. Finally, we adapt NHF to the context of Bayesian inference and illustrate our method on sampling the posterior distribution of two cosmological parameters knowing type Ia supernovae observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise and accurate predictions over boundary areas are essential for semantic segmentation. However, the commonly-used convolutional operators tend to smooth and blur local detail cues, making it difficult for deep models to generate accurate boundary predictions. In this paper, we introduce an operator-level approach to enhance semantic boundary awareness, so as to improve the prediction of the deep semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we first formulate the boundary feature enhancement as an anisotropic diffusion process. We then propose a novel learnable approach called semantic diffusion network (SDN) to approximate the diffusion process, which contains a parameterized semantic difference convolution operator followed by a feature fusion module. Our SDN aims to construct a differentiable mapping from the original feature to the inter-class boundary-enhanced feature. The proposed SDN is an efficient and flexible module that can be easily plugged into existing encoder-decoder segmentation models. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve consistent improvements over several typical and state-of-the-art segmentation baseline models on challenging public benchmarks. The code will be released soon.

 - **Abstract**
 Computational modeling of neurodynamical systems often deploys neural networks and symbolic dynamics. A particular way for combining these approaches within a framework called vector symbolic architectures leads to neural automata. An interesting research direction we have pursued under this framework has been to consider mapping symbolic dynamics onto neurodynamics, represented as neural automata. This representation theory, enables us to ask questions, such as, how does the brain implement Turing computations. Specifically, in this representation theory, neural automata result from the assignment of symbols and symbol strings to numbers, known as G\"odel encoding. Under this assignment symbolic computation becomes represented by trajectories of state vectors in a real phase space, that allows for statistical correlation analyses with real-world measurements and experimental data. However, these assignments are usually completely arbitrary. Hence, it makes sense to address the problem question of, which aspects of the dynamics observed under such a representation is intrinsic to the dynamics and which are not. In this study, we develop a formally rigorous mathematical framework for the investigation of symmetries and invariants of neural automata under different encodings. As a central concept we define patterns of equality for such systems. We consider different macroscopic observables, such as the mean activation level of the neural network, and ask for their invariance properties. Our main result shows that only step functions that are defined over those patterns of equality are invariant under recodings, while the mean activation is not. Our work could be of substantial importance for related regression studies of real-world measurements with neurosymbolic processors for avoiding confounding results that are dependant on a particular encoding and not intrinsic to the dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Autonomous exploration is one of the important parts to achieve the fast autonomous mapping and target search. However, most of the existing methods are facing low-efficiency problems caused by low-quality trajectory or back-and-forth maneuvers. To improve the exploration efficiency in unknown environments, a fast autonomous exploration planner (FAEP) is proposed in this paper. Different from existing methods, we firstly design a novel frontiers exploration sequence generation method to obtain a more reasonable exploration path, which considers not only the flight-level but frontier-level factors in the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Then, according to the exploration sequence and the distribution of frontiers, an adaptive yaw planning method is proposed to cover more frontiers by yaw change during an exploration journey. In addition, to increase the speed and fluency of flight, a dynamic replanning strategy is also adopted. We present sufficient comparison and evaluation experiments in simulation environments. Experimental results show the proposed exploration planner has better performance in terms of flight time and flight distance compared to typical and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is further evaluated in real-world environments.
### Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Source Label Adaptation

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) involves learning to classify unseen target data with a few labeled and lots of unlabeled target data, along with many labeled source data from a related domain. Current SSDA approaches usually aim at aligning the target data to the labeled source data with feature space mapping and pseudo-label assignments. Nevertheless, such a source-oriented model can sometimes align the target data to source data of the wrong classes, degrading the classification performance. This paper presents a novel source-adaptive paradigm that adapts the source data to match the target data. Our key idea is to view the source data as a noisily-labeled version of the ideal target data. Then, we propose an SSDA model that cleans up the label noise dynamically with the help of a robust cleaner component designed from the target perspective. Since the paradigm is very different from the core ideas behind existing SSDA approaches, our proposed model can be easily coupled with them to improve their performance. Empirical results on two state-of-the-art SSDA approaches demonstrate that the proposed model effectively cleans up the noise within the source labels and exhibits superior performance over those approaches across benchmark datasets.
### Domain Re-Modulation for Few-Shot Generative Domain Adaptation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02550
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the task of few-shot Generative Domain Adaptation (GDA), which involves transferring a pre-trained generator from one domain to a new domain using one or a few reference images. Building upon previous research that has focused on Target-domain Consistency, Large Diversity, and Cross-domain Consistency, we conclude two additional desired properties for GDA: Memory and Domain Association. To meet these properties, we proposed a novel method Domain Re-Modulation (DoRM). Specifically, DoRM freezes the source generator and employs additional mapping and affine modules (M&A module) to capture the attributes of the target domain, resulting in a linearly combinable domain shift in style space. This allows for high-fidelity multi-domain and hybrid-domain generation by integrating multiple M&A modules in a single generator. DoRM is lightweight and easy to implement. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superior performance of DoRM on both one-shot and 10-shot GDA, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, for the first time, multi-domain and hybrid-domain generation can be achieved with a minimal storage cost by using a single model. The code will be available at https://github.com/wuyi2020/DoRM.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01987
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose REASON, a novel framework that enables the automatic discovery of both intra-level (i.e., within-network) and inter-level (i.e., across-network) causal relationships for root cause localization. REASON consists of Topological Causal Discovery and Individual Causal Discovery. The Topological Causal Discovery component aims to model the fault propagation in order to trace back to the root causes. To achieve this, we propose novel hierarchical graph neural networks to construct interdependent causal networks by modeling both intra-level and inter-level non-linear causal relations. Based on the learned interdependent causal networks, we then leverage random walks with restarts to model the network propagation of a system fault. The Individual Causal Discovery component focuses on capturing abrupt change patterns of a single system entity. This component examines the temporal patterns of each entity's metric data (i.e., time series), and estimates its likelihood of being a root cause based on the Extreme Value theory. Combining the topological and individual causal scores, the top K system entities are identified as root causes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.
### MixFormer: End-to-End Tracking with Iterative Mixed Attention

 - **Abstract**
 Visual object tracking often employs a multi-stage pipeline of feature extraction, target information integration, and bounding box estimation. To simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration, in this paper, we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer trackers simply by stacking multiple MAMs and placing a localization head on top. Specifically, we instantiate two types of MixFormer trackers, a hierarchical tracker MixCvT, and a non-hierarchical tracker MixViT. For these two trackers, we investigate a series of pre-training methods and uncover the different behaviors between supervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training in our MixFormer trackers. We also extend the masked pre-training to our MixFormer trackers and design the competitive TrackMAE pre-training technique. Finally, to handle multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer trackers set a new state-of-the-art performance on seven tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, OTB100 and UAV123. In particular, our MixViT-L achieves AUC score of 73.3% on LaSOT, 86.1% on TrackingNet, EAO of 0.584 on VOT2020, and AO of 75.7% on GOT-10k. Code and trained models will be made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MixFormer.

 - **Abstract**
 Indoor positioning systems have received a lot of attention recently due to their importance for many location-based services, e.g. indoor navigation and smart buildings. Lightweight solutions based on WiFi and inertial sensing have gained popularity, but are not fit for demanding applications, such as expert museum guides and industrial settings, which typically require sub-meter location information. In this paper, we propose a novel positioning system, RAVEL (Radio And Vision Enhanced Localization), which fuses anonymous visual detections captured by widely available camera infrastructure, with radio readings (e.g. WiFi radio data). Although visual trackers can provide excellent positioning accuracy, they are plagued by issues such as occlusions and people entering/exiting the scene, preventing their use as a robust tracking solution. By incorporating radio measurements, visually ambiguous or missing data can be resolved through multi-hypothesis tracking. We evaluate our system in a complex museum environment with dim lighting and multiple people moving around in a space cluttered with exhibit stands. Our experiments show that although the WiFi measurements are not by themselves sufficiently accurate, when they are fused with camera data, they become a catalyst for pulling together ambiguous, fragmented, and anonymous visual tracklets into accurate and continuous paths, yielding typical errors below 1 meter.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01984
 - **Abstract**
 Self-attention mechanisms have enabled transformers to achieve superhuman-level performance on many speech-to-text (STT) tasks, yet the challenge of automatic prosodic segmentation has remained unsolved. In this paper we finetune Whisper, a pretrained STT model, to annotate intonation unit (IU) boundaries by repurposing low-frequency tokens. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 95.8%, outperforming previous methods without the need for large-scale labeled data or enterprise grade compute resources. We also diminish input signals by applying a series of filters, finding that low pass filters at a 3.2 kHz level improve segmentation performance in out of sample and out of distribution contexts. We release our model as both a transcription tool and a baseline for further improvements in prosodic segmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Offloading computationally heavy tasks from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a remote server helps improve the battery life and can help reduce resource requirements. Deep learning based state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, such as object segmentation and object detection, are computationally heavy algorithms, requiring large memory and computing power. Many UAVs are using (pretrained) off-the-shelf versions of such algorithms. Offloading such power-hungry algorithms to a remote server could help UAVs save power significantly. However, deep learning based algorithms are susceptible to noise, and a wireless communication system, by its nature, introduces noise to the original signal. When the signal represents an image, noise affects the image. There has not been much work studying the effect of the noise introduced by the communication system on pretrained deep networks. In this work, we first analyze how reliable it is to offload deep learning based computer vision tasks (including both object segmentation and detection) by focusing on the effect of various parameters of a 5G wireless communication system on the transmitted image and demonstrate how the introduced noise of the used 5G wireless communication system reduces the performance of the offloaded deep learning task. Then solutions are introduced to eliminate (or reduce) the negative effect of the noise. The proposed framework starts with introducing many classical techniques as alternative solutions first, and then introduces a novel deep learning based solution to denoise the given noisy input image. The performance of various denoising algorithms on offloading both object segmentation and object detection tasks are compared. Our proposed deep transformer-based denoiser algorithm (NR-Net) yields the state-of-the-art results on reducing the negative effect of the noise in our experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Tabular data is a common form of organizing data. Multiple models are available to generate synthetic tabular datasets where observations are independent, but few have the ability to produce relational datasets. Modeling relational data is challenging as it requires modeling both a "parent" table and its relationships across tables. We introduce REaLTabFormer (Realistic Relational and Tabular Transformer), a tabular and relational synthetic data generation model. It first creates a parent table using an autoregressive GPT-2 model, then generates the relational dataset conditioned on the parent table using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. We implement target masking to prevent data copying and propose the $Q_{\delta}$ statistic and statistical bootstrapping to detect overfitting. Experiments using real-world datasets show that REaLTabFormer captures the relational structure better than a baseline model. REaLTabFormer also achieves state-of-the-art results on prediction tasks, "out-of-the-box", for large non-relational datasets without needing fine-tuning.

 - **Abstract**
 In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformers have already revolutionized the field by utilizing an attention-based encoder-decoder model. Recently, some pioneering works have employed Transformer-like architectures in Computer Vision (CV) and they have reported outstanding performance of these architectures in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance improvements over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their competitive modelling capabilities. However, these architectures demand massive computational resources which makes these models difficult to be deployed in the resource-constrained applications. Many solutions have been developed to combat this issue, such as compressive transformers and compression functions such as dilated convolution, min-max pooling, 1D convolution, etc. Model compression has recently attracted considerable research attention as a potential remedy. A number of model compression methods have been proposed in the literature such as weight quantization, weight multiplexing, pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, techniques like weight quantization, pruning and weight multiplexing typically involve complex pipelines for performing the compression. KD has been found to be a simple and much effective model compression technique that allows a relatively simple model to perform tasks almost as accurately as a complex model. This paper discusses various approaches based upon KD for effective compression of ViT models. The paper elucidates the role played by KD in reducing the computational and memory requirements of these models. The paper also presents the various challenges faced by ViTs that are yet to be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) remains a significant yet challenging research problem in the realm of visual reasoning. A VCR model generally aims at answering a textual question regarding an image, followed by the rationale prediction for the preceding answering process. Though these two processes are sequential and intertwined, existing methods always consider them as two independent matching-based instances. They, therefore, ignore the pivotal relationship between the two processes, leading to sub-optimal model performance. This paper presents a novel visual attention alignment method to efficaciously handle these two processes in a unified framework. To achieve this, we first design a re-attention module for aggregating the vision attention map produced in each process. Thereafter, the resultant two sets of attention maps are carefully aligned to guide the two processes to make decisions based on the same image regions. We apply this method to both conventional attention and the recent Transformer models and carry out extensive experiments on the VCR benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that with the attention alignment module, our method achieves a considerable improvement over the baseline methods, evidently revealing the feasibility of the coupling of the two processes as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 Prior work has attempted to understand the internal structures and functionalities of Transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures on the level of multi-head attention and feed-forward sublayers. Interpretations have focused on the encoder and decoder, along with the combinatorial possibilities of the self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward sublayers. Could we improve the quality of translation by diving into the Transformer sublayer abstractions and permuting its layer weight matrices? We propose AEIUOrder to greedily reorder layer weight matrices in the encoder by their well-trainedness, as measured by Random Matrix Theory (RMT) metrics, and reverse the ordering scheme for the encoder. The objective is to maximize Total well-trainedness in the encoder while the decoder structure serves to represent the reverse process of encoding. On the standard Transformer (6 layers, model dimension 512), AEIUOrder achieves a BLEU score of 34.62 (baseline 34.31) on the IWSLT 2016 German-to-English translation task, and 27.95 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task (baseline 27.91). AEIUOrder is also realized on Transformers with various depths and embedding dimensions, showing significant improvements on deeper, wider models than on their shallower, slimmer counterparts. For instance, the 8-layer, 768-dimension and the 4-layer, 1024-dimension Transformers achieve respective 29.1 and 29.31 BLEU scores on the IWSLT 2016 English-to-German translation task (28.53 and 28.97 on respective baselines). Our results suggest that the RMT-motivated approach to maximize \textit{Total well-trainedness}, by greedily reordering its layer weight matrices, facilitates the model to learn representations and generate translations more effectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning aims to generate coherent captions for multiple adjacent images in a news document. There are coherence relationships among adjacent images because they often describe same entities or events. These relationships are important for entity-aware multi-image captioning, but are neglected in entity-aware single-image captioning. Most existing work focuses on single-image captioning, while multi-image captioning has not been explored before. Hence, this paper proposes a coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning model by making use of coherence relationships. The model consists of a Transformer-based caption generation model and two types of contrastive learning-based coherence mechanisms. The generation model generates the caption by paying attention to the image and the accompanying text. The horizontal coherence mechanism aims to the make the caption coherent with captions of adjacent images. The vertical coherence mechanism aims to make the caption coherent with the image and the accompanying text. To evaluate coherence between captions, two coherence evaluation metrics are proposed. The new dataset DM800K is constructed that has more images per document than two existing datasets GoodNews and NYT800K, and are more suitable for multi-image captioning. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed captioning model outperforms 6 baselines according to single-image captioning evaluations, and the generated captions are more coherent than that of baselines according to coherence evaluations and human evaluations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a new method for end-to-end Video Question Answering (VideoQA), aside from the current popularity of using large-scale pre-training with huge feature extractors. We achieve this with a pyramidal multimodal transformer (PMT) model, which simply incorporates a learnable word embedding layer, a few convolutional and transformer layers. We use the anisotropic pyramid to fulfill video-language interactions across different spatio-temporal scales. In addition to the canonical pyramid, which includes both bottom-up and top-down pathways with lateral connections, novel strategies are proposed to decompose the visual feature stream into spatial and temporal sub-streams at different scales and implement their interactions with the linguistic semantics while preserving the integrity of local and global semantics. We demonstrate better or on-par performances with high computational efficiency against state-of-the-art methods on five VideoQA benchmarks. Our ablation study shows the scalability of our model that achieves competitive results for text-to-video retrieval by leveraging feature extractors with reusable pre-trained weights, and also the effectiveness of the pyramid.

 - **Abstract**
 Lipreading refers to understanding and further translating the speech of a speaker in the video into natural language. State-of-the-art lipreading methods excel in interpreting overlap speakers, i.e., speakers appear in both training and inference sets. However, generalizing these methods to unseen speakers incurs catastrophic performance degradation due to the limited number of speakers in training bank and the evident visual variations caused by the shape/color of lips for different speakers. Therefore, merely depending on the visible changes of lips tends to cause model overfitting. To address this problem, we propose to use multi-modal features across visual and landmarks, which can describe the lip motion irrespective to the speaker identities. Then, we develop a sentence-level lipreading framework based on visual-landmark transformers, namely LipFormer. Specifically, LipFormer consists of a lip motion stream, a facial landmark stream, and a cross-modal fusion. The embeddings from the two streams are produced by self-attention, which are fed to the cross-attention module to achieve the alignment between visuals and landmarks. Finally, the resulting fused features can be decoded to output texts by a cascade seq2seq model. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the model generalization to unseen speakers.

 - **Abstract**
 Image deblurring aims to recover the latent sharp image from its blurry counterpart and has a wide range of applications in computer vision. The Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed well in this domain for many years, and until recently an alternative network architecture, namely Transformer, has demonstrated even stronger performance. One can attribute its superiority to the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, which offers a larger receptive field and better input content adaptability than CNNs. However, as MHSA demands high computational costs that grow quadratically with respect to the input resolution, it becomes impractical for high-resolution image deblurring tasks. In this work, we propose a unified lightweight CNN network that features a large effective receptive field (ERF) and demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Transformers while bearing less computational costs. Our key design is an efficient CNN block dubbed LaKD, equipped with a large kernel depth-wise convolution and spatial-channel mixing structure, attaining comparable or larger ERF than Transformers but with a smaller parameter scale. Specifically, we achieve +0.17dB / +0.43dB PSNR over the state-of-the-art Restormer on defocus / motion deblurring benchmark datasets with 32% fewer parameters and 39% fewer MACs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our network and the effectiveness of each module. Furthermore, we propose a compact and intuitive ERFMeter metric that quantitatively characterizes ERF, and shows a high correlation to the network performance. We hope this work can inspire the research community to further explore the pros and cons of CNN and Transformer architectures beyond image deblurring tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing interacting hands from a single RGB image is a very challenging task. On the one hand, severe mutual occlusion and similar local appearance between two hands confuse the extraction of visual features, resulting in the misalignment of estimated hand meshes and the image. On the other hand, there are complex interaction patterns between interacting hands, which significantly increases the solution space of hand poses and increases the difficulty of network learning. In this paper, we propose a decoupled iterative refinement framework to achieve pixel-alignment hand reconstruction while efficiently modeling the spatial relationship between hands. Specifically, we define two feature spaces with different characteristics, namely 2D visual feature space and 3D joint feature space. First, we obtain joint-wise features from the visual feature map and utilize a graph convolution network and a transformer to perform intra- and inter-hand information interaction in the 3D joint feature space, respectively. Then, we project the joint features with global information back into the 2D visual feature space in an obfuscation-free manner and utilize the 2D convolution for pixel-wise enhancement. By performing multiple alternate enhancements in the two feature spaces, our method can achieve an accurate and robust reconstruction of interacting hands. Our method outperforms all existing two-hand reconstruction methods by a large margin on the InterHand2.6M dataset. Meanwhile, our method shows a strong generalization ability for in-the-wild images.

 - **Abstract**
 Dot-product attention mechanism plays a crucial role in modern deep architectures (e.g., Transformer) for sequence modeling, however, na\"ive exact computation of this model incurs quadratic time and memory complexities in sequence length, hindering the training of long-sequence models. Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models. On BigGAN image generation, we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over $4\times$ speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over $18\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than $0.5\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) generation aims to generate scene graph representations based on panoptic segmentation instead of rigid bounding boxes. Existing PSG methods utilize one-stage paradigm which simultaneously generates scene graphs and predicts semantic segmentation masks or two-stage paradigm that first adopt an off-the-shelf panoptic segmentor, then pairwise relationship prediction between these predicted objects. One-stage approach despite having a simplified training paradigm, its segmentation results are usually under-satisfactory, while two-stage approach lacks global context and leads to low performance on relation prediction. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose GRNet, a Global Relation Network in two-stage paradigm, where the pre-extracted local object features and their corresponding masks are fed into a transformer with class embeddings. To handle relation ambiguity and predicate classification bias caused by long-tailed distribution, we formulate relation prediction in the second stage as a multi-class classification task with soft label. We conduct comprehensive experiments on OpenPSG dataset and achieve the state-of-art performance on the leadboard. We also show the effectiveness of our soft label strategy for long-tailed classes in ablation studies. Our code has been released in https://github.com/wangqixun/mfpsg.

 - **Abstract**
 Visual object tracking often employs a multi-stage pipeline of feature extraction, target information integration, and bounding box estimation. To simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration, in this paper, we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer trackers simply by stacking multiple MAMs and placing a localization head on top. Specifically, we instantiate two types of MixFormer trackers, a hierarchical tracker MixCvT, and a non-hierarchical tracker MixViT. For these two trackers, we investigate a series of pre-training methods and uncover the different behaviors between supervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training in our MixFormer trackers. We also extend the masked pre-training to our MixFormer trackers and design the competitive TrackMAE pre-training technique. Finally, to handle multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer trackers set a new state-of-the-art performance on seven tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, OTB100 and UAV123. In particular, our MixViT-L achieves AUC score of 73.3% on LaSOT, 86.1% on TrackingNet, EAO of 0.584 on VOT2020, and AO of 75.7% on GOT-10k. Code and trained models will be made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MixFormer.

 - **Abstract**
 Scaling DNNs is shown to deliver dramatic quality gains across ML problems. This, however, has also led to a concomitant quadratic increase in computation cost. To tackle this, along with the failure of accelerator memory capacity to keep up, training these models increasingly relies on distributed training techniques. As such, an important question of interest is: how will compute and communication relatively scale as models scale and hardware evolves? A careful study which answers this question can better guide the design of future systems. To this end, this work provides a comprehensive multi-axial (algorithmic, empirical, hardware evolution) analysis of compute vs. communication ($\textbf{Comp-vs.-Comm}$) scaling for future Transformer models on future hardware. Using algorithmic analysis we show that compute generally enjoys an edge over communication as models scale. However, when viewed through the lens of slower memory capacity scaling, these trends are being stressed. Next, we craft an empirical strategy to study Comp-vs.-Comm scaling for future models/hardware using existing hardware. This allows hundreds of future models/hardware scenarios to be studied at three orders of magnitude lower profiling costs. Our experiments demonstrate that communication will be a significant portion (about 40-75%) of execution as models and hardware evolve, and communication which is today hidden by overlapped computation will likely get exposed. Further, the generality of our strategy makes it a strong basis to perform Comp-vs.-Comm scaling analysis for any future model. Overall, this work underscores the increasingly large role communication will play as models scale.

 Fine-tuning Transformer-based approaches have recently shown exciting results on sentence simplification task. However, so far, no research has applied similar approaches to the Lexical Simplification (LS) task. In this paper, we present ConLS, a Controllable Lexical Simplification system fine-tuned with T5 (a Transformer-based model pre-trained with a BERT-style approach and several other tasks). The evaluation results on three datasets (LexMTurk, BenchLS, and NNSeval) have shown that our model performs comparable to LSBert (the current state-of-the-art) and even outperforms it in some cases. We also conducted a detailed comparison on the effectiveness of control tokens to give a clear view of how each token contributes to the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Transformers, have shown great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. However, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. This paper doubles as a review and a practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory and typical computer science applications. Using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. We structure our review and discussion as a set of practical selection criteria and usage guidelines. Throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple 2-dimensional example problems. Finally, to illustrate the selection process and classic usage of the presented metrics, we evaluate three deep generative models on a multifaceted bicycle frame design problem considering performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints. We publicly release the code for the datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/.

 We present GPS++, a hybrid Message Passing Neural Network / Graph Transformer model for molecular property prediction. Our model integrates a well-tuned local message passing component and biased global attention with other key ideas from prior literature to achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale molecular dataset PCQM4Mv2. Through a thorough ablation study we highlight the impact of individual components and, contrary to expectations set by recent trends, find that nearly all of the model's performance can be maintained without any use of global self-attention. We also show that our approach is significantly more accurate than prior art when 3D positional information is not available.

 Accurate predictive models of the visual cortex neural response to natural visual stimuli remain a challenge in computational neuroscience. In this work, we introduce V1T, a novel Vision Transformer based architecture that learns a shared visual and behavioral representation across animals. We evaluate our model on two large datasets recorded from mouse primary visual cortex and outperform previous convolution-based models by more than 12.7% in prediction performance. Moreover, we show that the attention weights learned by the Transformer correlate with the population receptive fields. Our model thus sets a new benchmark for neural response prediction and captures characteristic features of the visual cortex.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent vision transformer based video models mostly follow the ``image pre-training then finetuning" paradigm and have achieved great success on multiple video benchmarks. However, full finetuning such a video model could be computationally expensive and unnecessary, given the pre-trained image transformer models have demonstrated exceptional transferability. In this work, we propose a novel method to Adapt pre-trained Image Models (AIM) for efficient video understanding. By freezing the pre-trained image model and adding a few lightweight Adapters, we introduce spatial adaptation, temporal adaptation and joint adaptation to gradually equip an image model with spatiotemporal reasoning capability. We show that our proposed AIM can achieve competitive or even better performance than prior arts with substantially fewer tunable parameters on four video action recognition benchmarks. Thanks to its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to different image pre-trained models, which has the potential to leverage more powerful image foundation models in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Image-based environment perception is an important component especially for driver assistance systems or autonomous driving. In this scope, modern neuronal networks are used to identify multiple objects as well as the according position and size information within a single frame. The performance of such an object detection model is important for the overall performance of the whole system. However, a detection model might also predict these objects under a certain degree of uncertainty. [...] In this work, we examine the semantic uncertainty (which object type?) as well as the spatial uncertainty (where is the object and how large is it?). We evaluate if the predicted uncertainties of an object detection model match with the observed error that is achieved on real-world data. In the first part of this work, we introduce the definition for confidence calibration of the semantic uncertainty in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. We integrate additional position information in our examinations to evaluate the effect of the object's position on the semantic calibration properties. Besides measuring calibration, it is also possible to perform a post-hoc recalibration of semantic uncertainty that might have turned out to be miscalibrated. [...] The second part of this work deals with the spatial uncertainty obtained by a probabilistic detection model. [...] We review and extend common calibration methods so that it is possible to obtain parametric uncertainty distributions for the position information in a more flexible way. In the last part, we demonstrate a possible use-case for our derived calibration methods in the context of object tracking. [...] We integrate our previously proposed calibration techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of semantic and spatial uncertainty calibration in a subsequent process. [...]

 - **Abstract**
 Deep neural networks (DNN) which are employed in perception systems for autonomous driving require a huge amount of data to train on, as they must reliably achieve high performance in all kinds of situations. However, these DNN are usually restricted to a closed set of semantic classes available in their training data, and are therefore unreliable when confronted with previously unseen instances. Thus, multiple perception datasets have been created for the evaluation of anomaly detection methods, which can be categorized into three groups: real anomalies in real-world, synthetic anomalies augmented into real-world and completely synthetic scenes. This survey provides a structured and, to the best of our knowledge, complete overview and comparison of perception datasets for anomaly detection in autonomous driving. Each chapter provides information about tasks and ground truth, context information, and licenses. Additionally, we discuss current weaknesses and gaps in existing datasets to underline the importance of developing further data.

 - **Abstract**
 Safety is critical for autonomous driving, and one aspect of improving safety is to accurately capture the uncertainties of the perception system, especially knowing the unknown. Different from only providing deterministic or probabilistic results, e.g., probabilistic object detection, that only provide partial information for the perception scenario, we propose a complete probabilistic model named GevBEV. It interprets the 2D driving space as a probabilistic Bird's Eye View (BEV) map with point-based spatial Gaussian distributions, from which one can draw evidence as the parameters for the categorical Dirichlet distribution of any new sample point in the continuous driving space. The experimental results show that GevBEV not only provides more reliable uncertainty quantification but also outperforms the previous works on the benchmark OPV2V of BEV map interpretation for cooperative perception. A critical factor in cooperative perception is the data transmission size through the communication channels. GevBEV helps reduce communication overhead by selecting only the most important information to share from the learned uncertainty, reducing the average information communicated by 80% with a slight performance drop.
